/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * columnar_objstore.h
 *		The ABI between pgColumnar and its object-store module (#393).
 *
 * Object-store support lives in a SEPARATE, non-preloaded shared library. The
 * reason is measured rather than stylistic: pgColumnar loads through
 * shared_preload_libraries, so anything it links is mapped into the postmaster
 * and inherited by every backend through fork, whether or not any query ever
 * reads a remote file. libcurl alone resolves to 30 shared objects against this
 * extension's 4, including two TLS implementations, and an OpenSSL-linked client
 * brings a TLS stack into a postmaster that may have none.
 *
 * PostgreSQL made the same call for its own libcurl dependency: configure
 * default off, a separate shared library, runtime dlopen behind a frozen ABI,
 * and a separate distribution package. This follows that shape.
 *
 * The module is loaded with load_external_function on the first read of a remote
 * path and never before. A build or an install without it is fully functional for
 * local files.
 *
 * A missing module reports the remote path as unsupported. That needs a PG_TRY in
 * the loader and not just signalNotFound = false, because signalNotFound
 * suppresses a missing SYMBOL while a missing LIBRARY is raised earlier, by
 * internal_load_library, before the symbol lookup happens.
 *
 * VERSIONING. Bump PGCOLUMNAR_OBJSTORE_ABI whenever the meaning or the order of
 * anything below changes. The loader refuses a mismatch, because the failure it
 * prevents is a wrong function called through a stale pointer.
