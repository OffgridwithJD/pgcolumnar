 *
 * columnar_row_lock.c
 *		Serialize concurrent writers of the SAME columnar row (issue #5, the
 *		UPDATE facet).
 *
 * A columnar UPDATE is delete-old plus insert-new, and a DELETE marks a bit in
 * the delete vector. Neither takes a lock on the row identity, and
 * pgcolumnar_tuple_lock does not implement row locking, so core never runs
 * EvalPlanQual. Two transactions updating the same row therefore each keep their
 * own new version: the old row is deleted once and both new rows survive, so the
 * row is duplicated and one update is lost. A heap serializes this transparently.
 *
 * The serialization happens at delete-vector FLUSH time, not per row in the
 * table-AM callbacks, so the row-identity locks can be acquired in a single
 * sorted batch. This mirrors the issue #4 discipline in delete_vector_flush_buffer
 * (list_sort before taking the chunk-group locks): every transaction acquires in
 * the same order, so no AB-BA cycle forms. Acquiring incrementally per row (in
 * scan order) would take the bucketed locks in a transaction-dependent order and
 * deadlock two transactions touching unrelated rows that share a bucket.
 *
 * The flow, gated by pgcolumnar.enable_row_update_lock:
 *   1. PgColumnarRowWriteConflict, called by pgcolumnar_tuple_update and
 *      pgcolumnar_tuple_delete BEFORE marking the old row deleted, reports a
 *      same-command self-modify (the row is already in this command's own buffer)
 *      as TM_SelfModified, so a self-join UPDATE ... FROM resolves as it does for
 *      a heap. This runs even with the GUC off; it is a deterministic correctness
 *      fix independent of concurrency.
 *   2. PgColumnarSerializeFlushRows, called from delete_vector_flush_buffer before
 *      the delete-vector upsert, sorts the flushed rows by lock key, takes a
 *      transaction-scoped advisory lock on each (all held to commit), then re-reads
 *      the LATEST committed state (GetLatestSnapshot, not the caller snapshot,
 *      which PgColumnarCatalogSnapshot only copies) and raises a retryable
 *      serialization_failure if any of these rows was committed-deleted by a
 *      concurrent transaction. The lock waits out the competitor; the committed
 *      re-read decides whether a conflict actually happened, so a hash-bucket
 *      collision can only add waiting, never a false failure.
 *
 * A conflict is a row whose COMMITTED group still EXISTS and whose bit is set. A
 * row whose group is gone (retired by a concurrent rewrite) is left to the
 * flush-time Phase F3b check in PgColumnarUpsertDeleteVector, which raises its own
 * "row group was compacted concurrently" error; it is also the read-your-writes
 * case for a row this transaction just inserted, which is not a conflict.
 *
 * The loser gets one retryable serialization_failure at every isolation level,
 * matching a heap at REPEATABLE READ and what columnar already gave at
 * SERIALIZABLE. READ COMMITTED is stricter than a heap: the loser retries rather
 * than re-applying via EvalPlanQual. See docs/limitations.md.
 *
 * Written fresh for pgColumnar. It reuses no upstream source; it derives from the
 * issue #5 design analysis and the public PostgreSQL API. See PROVENANCE.md.
