/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pgcolumnar_parquet_format.h
 *		Parquet and Thrift compact-protocol constants, shared by the reader and
 *		the writer.
 *
 * These are values defined by the file format, not by this implementation, so
 * there is exactly one correct value for each and both directions must agree on
 * it. They were previously declared twice, once in pgcolumnar_parquet.c and once
 * in pgcolumnar_parquet_reader.c, with 21 names in common. The values did agree,
 * but nothing made them: a writer and a reader that disagree on a type code
 * produce a file that is silently wrong rather than one that fails to parse,
 * which is the worst shape a defect can take here.
 *
 * Only format constants belong in this file. A value this implementation chooses
 * for itself -- a buffer bound, a resolved-unit enum, a sentinel -- stays in the
 * module that chooses it, because it has no counterpart on the other side.
 *
 * Written fresh for pgColumnar from the public Apache Parquet and Apache Thrift
 * compact-protocol specifications.

/*
 * pq_bits_for
 *		The bit width the RLE/bit-pack level encoding uses for a maximum
 *		definition or repetition level: the smallest b with maxval < 2^b.
 *
 *		Shared rather than duplicated for the reason this whole header exists.
 *		The writer and the reader each had their own copy, byte-identical and
 *		with nothing making them stay that way, and a writer and a reader that
 *		disagree on a level width produce a file that is silently wrong rather
 *		than one that fails to parse (#710).
 *
 *		The shift is UNSIGNED and the loop is BOUNDED, and both matter:
 *
 *		`1 << b` is signed, so it is undefined once b reaches 31, which the loop
 *		reaches for any maxval >= 2^30. Not reachable from a real schema --
 *		levels accumulate one per nesting level from a recursion that
 *		check_stack_depth bounds -- but it is undefined behaviour sitting in a
 *		decoder that reads attacker-authored files, and the compiler is entitled
 *		to assume it cannot happen.
 *
 *		`1u << b` alone is NOT the whole fix. It makes the comparison unsigned,
 *		so a negative maxval converts to a huge unsigned value and the loop runs
 *		to b == 32, where the unsigned shift is undefined in its own right. The
 *		non-positive guard and the b < 31 bound close both ends, and make the
 *		function correct over the whole int domain instead of resting on a
 *		caller property two files away.
