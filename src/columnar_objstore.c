 * Open a LOCAL regular file for reading with no stat-before-open race.
 *
 * AllocateFile()/fopen("rb") on a FIFO blocks in open(2) until a writer appears;
 * because our signal handlers use SA_RESTART the blocked open resumes across
 * SIGINT/SIGALRM, so neither a query cancel nor statement_timeout gets the
 * backend back (a cancel-resistant availability DoS, #644/#686). A plain stat()
 * before the open avoids the block but races: a local principal who can write the
 * directory can swap the checked regular file for a FIFO between the stat and the
 * open, re-introducing the block.
 *
 * So open once, O_NONBLOCK (a FIFO then returns immediately instead of blocking),
 * fstat the fd we hold -- the file we checked is the file we opened -- refuse a
 * non-regular file, then clear O_NONBLOCK for the read. This is the same pattern
 * as pcopy_open_regular_file, and it is the single opener every local Iceberg,
 * Avro, Parquet, and Arrow read reaches. The DATA_CORRUPTED code matches the
 * malformed-metadata refusals the read path already raises.
 *
 * A regular file (or a symlink to one; the open follows it) is allowed. A path
 * that does not exist is left as the open's errno-by-name error. Remote paths are
 * excluded by the caller (they are not filesystem objects).
