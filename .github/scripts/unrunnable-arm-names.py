"""Every unrunnable record must name the check it stands in for.

#1040. `check_unrunnable NAME REASON DETAIL` gives one check the honesty
`pgc_skip` gives a whole suite: the check did not run, and the reader is told
WHICH. That only works if the record carries the name the check uses when it DOES
run. Where the two spellings differ the property has two ledger keys, and which
one appears depends on runtime state -- on `hilbert_locality` it depended on
whether that box's two partitions came out different that day.

This is part 470's property one helper over. 470 asks whether a skip LOOP still
names the arms its sibling branch emits; this asks whether an unrunnable record
names a check the same file asserts anywhere.

`check_skip` IS NOT SWEPT, and that is a finding rather than an omission. A
skipped arm has no runnable counterpart by construction -- the name IS the arm --
so 21 of its 23 call sites have no twin and always will. Sweeping it would report
21 mismatches that are all correct code. For the same reason a SKIP record is not
a twin: neither side ran.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT COMPARED, printed rather than assumed:

    sites      every name passed to a refusal emitter
    dynamic    the whole name is one shell expansion, so there is no literal to
               compare (`arms_unrunnable` reads its names from a list)
    compared   the rest, where a missing twin is a real finding

`dynamic` is printed for the reason 470 prints `interpolated`: a comparison
nobody makes and a comparison that passes are indistinguishable in a total.

THREE THINGS THIS TOOL DERIVES RATHER THAN LISTS, each because a list of it was
wrong first:

1. WHICH FUNCTIONS RECORD, from the `pgc_record` call in their body. Two
   hand-written lists gave two wrong answers on this question. One omitted
   `pgc_pass`, and `projection_rewrite.sh` then reported a false orphan because
   its runnable twin records through `pgc_pass` and not a `check_*` helper.

2. WHICH ARGUMENT IS THE NAME. `pgc_skip <capability> <message>` records
   `pgc_record FAIL "$2"`: the first quoted argument is the CAPABILITY, not the
   name. A reader assuming argument one takes `arrow` where the check is called
   `arrow support is present` -- the bash-side mirror of the name-position defect
   #1036 and #1038 closed on the python side. 22 call sites.
   `pgc_require_tools` records a FIXED name and takes no name argument at all.

3. WHAT COUNTS AS A REFUSAL, from the verdict recorded (`UNRUN`), not from the
   helper's spelling.

THE TWO SETS ARE ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE, because their failure directions are.
An over-broad REFUSAL set sweeps a site that did not need sweeping: extra work,
visible. An over-broad TWIN set supplies a name nothing records and turns a real
mismatch green: silent. So refusal wrappers are followed transitively, while the
twin set is restricted to `lib.sh` and to suite-local definitions spelled
`check` or `check_<word>`. `check[a-z_]*` is NOT that spelling: it also matches
`checks_in` in `decode_interrupts.sh`, a counting utility that records nothing
(@jdatcmd). A population named after a prefix is not a population named after a
behaviour.

AND THE SUBJECT MUST NOT BE IN THE REFERENCE SET. The first sweep of this
property subtracted the unrunnable names from the runnable set -- removing the
very names it was looking up -- so every name could only report absent and a
nine-for-nine file read as nine orphans. `--show-emitters` prints both sets so
the separation is inspectable rather than asserted.
