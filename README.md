A table created `USING pgcolumnar` stores its data by column, with per-column
compression, chunk-group skipping, and a vectorized aggregate path. It is for
analytic workloads: large scans, aggregates, and column projections over
append-mostly data.

pgColumnar builds from one source tree on PostgreSQL 15 through 18, with 19
validated against 19beta2, and is
licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). It is [pre-release](docs/limitations.md#release-status); the version marker
is `1.0-dev`, recorded in `VERSION`. A table `USING pgcolumnar` is stored in the
native on-disk format, PGCN v1.

## Quick start

Build with PGXS against the target server, add the library to
`shared_preload_libraries`, and restart:

```sh
make PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
make install PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
```

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pgcolumnar'
```

Then, in a database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgcolumnar;

CREATE TABLE events (id bigint, ts timestamptz, kind int, payload text)
  USING pgcolumnar;

INSERT INTO events
  SELECT g, now(), g % 8, 'p' || g
  FROM generate_series(1, 1000000) g;

SELECT count(*), avg(kind) FROM events WHERE kind = 3;
```

See the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for requirements and the
[user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for loading and querying.

## Independence

pgColumnar is an independent implementation. It is not derived from the source of
any other columnar project. Its on-disk format, metadata catalog, and SQL
interface are designed from published column-store research and the open Apache
Arrow, Parquet, and ORC specifications, and are recorded in
[design/NATIVE_FORMAT_AND_INTERFACE_SPEC.md](design/NATIVE_FORMAT_AND_INTERFACE_SPEC.md).
The implementation is built from that specification and the public PostgreSQL
API, by the clean-room method described in [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md).
