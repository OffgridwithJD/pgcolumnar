# Line and branch coverage over the suites, for one major.
#
# A discovery tool, not a gate. There is no threshold here and nothing in CI
# fails on the number, deliberately. A coverage threshold creates pressure to
# write tests that execute lines rather than tests that prove properties, and the
# assertions in this project's suites are the reason its defects get found. What
# the report answers is the complementary question a passing suite cannot: which
# code does nothing execute at all. For hand-rolled Parquet and Arrow decoders
# full of error paths, that is worth knowing.
#
# Expect the percentage to look unremarkable and expect that to be correct. A
# table access method carries defensive branches that should never be taken and
# columnar_compat.h carries version shims of which only one arm compiles per
# major. Read the report for holes, not for the number.
#
# Why the suites are driven directly rather than through run_all_versions.sh: the
# matrix builds its own copy of the tree in a temporary directory and removes it
# when the major finishes, which takes the .gcda counters with it. Coverage has to
# accumulate next to the objects it was compiled from, so this builds once in the
# working tree, installs that build, and runs every suite against it with
# PGC_SKIP_BUILD=1.
#
# Usage:  test/run_coverage.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#   PGC_COV_SUITES=<list>   override the suite list
#   PGC_COV_OUT=<dir>       output directory (default coverage/)
#
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# gcov writes each .gcda beside its object, at the absolute path recorded at
# COMPILE time, and it writes it as the process that ran the code. This runner is
# invoked under sudo in CI, so the build is root-owned, while lib.sh runs the
# server as `postgres` whenever it is root (lib.sh:150). The backend could not
# create a counter file next to a root-owned object, so no .gcda was ever written
# and `lcov --capture` had nothing to find. The report has measured nothing since
# the job was added (#740).
#
# The counters are REDIRECTED rather than the source tree being opened up.
# Chowning the object directories to the server user was the first fix and it is
# not sufficient: creating a file needs execute on every ANCESTOR too. Measured
# on the runner, with the object directories already chowned:
#
#     postgres:runner 755 /home/runner/work/pgcolumnar/pgcolumnar/src
#     postgres:runner 755 /home/runner/work/pgcolumnar/pgcolumnar
#     runner:runner   755 /home/runner/work/pgcolumnar
#     runner:runner   755 /home/runner/work
#     runner:runner   750 /home/runner        <-- no execute for postgres
#     root:root       755 /home
#
# /home/runner is 750 and postgres is neither its owner nor in the runner group,
# so it cannot traverse into the workspace at all, however the leaf directories
# are owned. That route could only work by chmod'ing the runner's home, which is
# not a thing to do to a shared runner.
#
# GCOV_PREFIX makes gcov write to $GCOV_PREFIX/<absolute path>.gcda instead.
# /tmp is world-writable and world-traversable, so this works whoever the server
# runs as and wherever the tree lives. GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=0 keeps the full path,
# which is what lets the counters be put back exactly where their .gcno are.
# runuser passes the environment through, so the postmaster and its backends
# inherit both variables.

# Every suite except the drivers, the libraries, and the ones that build their
# own server or need two majors. Kept in step with harness_selftest.sh's list.
#
# The two upgrade suites are excluded TOGETHER, and that pairing is the point
# (#741). run_all_versions.sh gates both behind PGC_RUN_UPGRADE, in one block and
# for one reason: they build a second copy of the extension and need an old
# source this runner has no way to supply. pg_upgrade was excluded here when it
# was written and extension_upgrade was not, so this runner discovered it, ran it
# with no old source, and its ref fallback could not resolve in a tagless CI
# checkout. run_coverage maps only rc 66 to SKIP, so that environment shortfall
# was counted as a failed suite and the nightly read "1 failed
# ( extension_upgrade)" every night while nothing was wrong with the product.
#
# Deciding to run an opt-in guard is run_all_versions.sh's job, not this one's.
# test/selftest/220 derives the gated list from that block and asserts every name
# in it is refused here, so a third upgrade suite cannot repeat this.
