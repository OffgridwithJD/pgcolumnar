# sum() and avg() over bigint accumulate in 128 bits (#785).
#
# The vectorized path used to convert EVERY value to numeric and call
# numeric_add per row: two pallocs and a full numeric addition for each row. A
# profile of that path was 13.0% make_result_opt_error, 9.3% add_abs, 8.1%
# init_var_from_num and 8.5% AllocSet alloc/free -- the numeric machinery, not
# the aggregate. Turning the documented fast path ON made sum(bigint) 2.03x
# SLOWER than leaving it off.
#
# It now accumulates in int128 and converts once at finalize, as core does.
#
# WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS SEPARATELY. pgcolumnar.enable_ungrouped_vector_agg is
# OFF by default, so the ordinary aggregate suites never reach this code at all.
# Every arm here sets it explicitly and asserts the plan really took the
# vectorized node, because an arm that silently fell back to the core Agg would
# pass while testing nothing.
#
# THE ARM THAT MATTERS MOST is the one whose sum exceeds int64. Below that, the
# conversion is a single int8_numeric and any implementation looks right. Above
# it the value must be reconstructed from two 64-bit halves, which is where an
# error would live, and it is the case a fixture of small numbers never reaches.
#
# HOW TO REVERT THIS FIX WHEN CHECKING THESE ARMS. `#undef HAVE_INT128` after
# the includes is a better mutation than deleting the code, and it is the
# reviewer's, not mine. It takes the platform fallback rather than removing the
# branches, so the 22 value arms below then exercise the NON-int128 path and
# check that it is still correct -- coverage neither of us set out to get. It
# also reproduces the timing result: 3.63x against the 3.68x that deleting the
# accumulator gave.
#
# Usage:  test/int8_agg_int128.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

#
# The 22 value arms above cannot see this fix removed. Reverting it restores the
# per-row numeric accumulation, which is CORRECT and merely slow, so all 22 stay
# green. The defect #785 records was speed, so the arm that guards it has to
# measure speed.
#
# It uses check_ratio and NOT check_ratio_needs_quiet_machine, and that distinction is the
# whole reason this arm runs at all: PGC_SKIP_TIMING=1 is set in ci.yml and in
# nightly.yml, so the _timing form would run in no automated gate while these 22
# arms still reported PASSED. That is a suite passing with its subject dropped.
#
# The exemption is the one cancel_decode.sh already states for itself: this is a
# ratio between two readings taken back to back in the same run on the same
# machine, not a ratio against a data-volume baseline. Both readings move
# together under load, which is what makes it safe on shared hardware where the
# wall-clock ratio suites are not.
#
# THE ASSERTION IS A BOUND, NOT A TARGET. "Not slower than the scalar path" is
# exactly the defect, and it does not encode how fast this machine is. The gap
# is wide: 2.03x slower before the fix, 1.65x faster after, and reverting it
# measures 3.63x to 3.68x against a 1.10x bound. A false red needs the machine
# to make the fixed arm more than 2x slower than it measures here.
