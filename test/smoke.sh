# pgColumnar phase 1 smoke test.
#
# Builds and installs the extension, spins up a throwaway PostgreSQL cluster
# as the postgres OS user, exercises create/insert/scan/drop on a columnar
# table, and checks the results. Written fresh for pgColumnar; it does not
# reuse any upstream test file or expected-output file.
#
# Usage:
#   test/smoke.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#
# PG_CONFIG defaults to /usr/local/pg17/bin/pg_config. Run as a user that may
# "runuser -u postgres" (e.g. root) when the current user is not postgres.

# this suite does not call, deliberately. Without this line every record it emits
# says `unknown`, and a ledger row claiming `unknown` matches no run, so none of
# these checks could ever be seeded or matched again.
#
# The runner passes the pg_config as $1 to EVERY suite, including those that need
# no cluster, so it is available here. `pgc_major_of` returns empty on a path it
# cannot run, which degrades to exactly today's `unknown` rather than to a WRONG
# major -- a guessed major would seed a row claiming a major the check was never
# observed on, which is worse than saying nothing.

# RECORDS RATHER THAN ONLY PRINTING (#965). This suite emitted nine human PASS
# lines and no RESULT records, so every mechanism built on the record vocabulary --
# the ledger, the census, checks_never_observed_red, the red-observation record,
# duplicate-name detection -- was blind to all nine. Measured: 0 RESULT lines.
#
# `pgc_record` takes the DISPLAY whole, so the human output below is byte-for-byte
# what it was. `fail` is still set, so this suite's own exit logic is untouched --
# the verdict line it prints is load-bearing until `checks run:` reconciles, and
# removing it in the same step would make the suite report less than it did before.
#
# NOT lib.sh's own `check`: that composes its own display and would drop the
# `: $got` suffix these lines carry, which is the measured value rather than a
# label. The name and the value are both wanted.
#
# AND THE `checks run:` LINE BELOW IS READ BY NOTHING YET, which is worth saying
# so the next conversion does not add it believing it wired something up
# (@jdatcmd, #969 review). The matrix decides whether to reconcile a suite by
# looking for the ACCOUNTING line -- `run_all_versions.sh` calls
# `pgc_log_shows_accounting`, which greps for
# `accounting: N passed + N failed + N unrunnable + N skipped = N` -- and this
# suite emits none, because it emits no accounting line. Measured: 0 accounting
# lines here against 1 in any suite that does.
#
# The line is still correct and still wanted: it is the total the records
# reconcile against, and `pgc_reconcile_records` returns 0 on this log when driven
# directly. So the remaining step is a gate flip rather than new work -- once
# whatever replaces the verdict line emits the accounting line, reconciliation
# starts working for all ten of these suites with no further change to them.
