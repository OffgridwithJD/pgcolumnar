# pgColumnar: what pgcolumnar.analyze() writes must have the SHAPE core writes
# (issue #414, the differential harness that lands with slice 3b).
#
# This suite exists because of one property of the API the function writes
# through. pg_restore_attribute_stats takes VARIADIC "any" and validates each
# argument's type at run time. A mistyped argument is not an error:
#
#     if (!stats_check_arg_array(fcinfo, attarginfo, MOST_COMMON_FREQS_ARG))
#     {
#         do_mcv = false;                     -- attribute_stats.c:247-251
#         result = false;
#     }
#
# It emits a WARNING, sets the argument to NULL, and carries on. The call then
# returns cleanly having stored nothing. Nothing in the value-level suite catches
# that: test/analyze_function.sh asserts our numbers are exact, and a statistic
# that was never written simply leaves core's earlier numbers in place, so the
# assertions read core's work and report on ours. That is not hypothetical -- the
# first draft of the slice 3b checks did exactly this and scored three of four
# passes against a function that wrote no most-common values at all.
#
# most_common_freqs is real[] and most_common_vals is text (attribute_stats.c:70-71);
# they are also a PAIR, so supplying one without the other drops both (:265).
# float8[] instead of real[] is the easiest mistake to make and the hardest to
# see, because plpgsql will happily produce one.
#
# So this suite compares SHAPE against core rather than values. Values must
# differ -- ours are exact and core's are sampled, which is the whole feature, so
# values cannot be the oracle. Shape must not differ: for every statistic kind we
# write, core writing the same kind for the same column must agree on the
# operator, the collation, and the element type of the stored array. A dropped
# argument leaves the slot absent, which a shape comparison sees immediately.
#
# Core ANALYZE is therefore the oracle here, the same way heap is the oracle for
# columnar in test/differential.sh.
#
# Usage:  test/analyze_differential.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# --- fixture ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Five types, because the failure this suite hunts is type-dependent. An int
# column can be written correctly by code that mangles every text column: the
# array literal for most_common_vals is built through the type's own output
# function, and the two text values below are the ones that break a literal
# assembled by hand instead -- one contains a comma, the other a quote.
#
# Each column is skewed the same way: two values repeat heavily and the rest are
# unique, so core produces both a most-common list and a histogram and there is a
# shape to compare. `b` is deliberately different: two distinct values, both
# repeated, so the MCV list describes the column completely and NEITHER core nor
# this function emits a histogram (analyze.c:2744, num_hist = ndistinct - num_mcv).

# Every column is one-in-seven NULL, and that is load-bearing rather than
# realistic. Frequencies are count / TOTAL rows including nulls (analyze.c:2720);
# dividing by the non-null count instead is the quiet defect this suite should
# catch. Written WITHOUT nulls -- as this fixture first was -- the two
# denominators are the same number, the frequency checks below cannot tell them
# apart, and the whole suite passed with that defect injected while
# test/analyze_function.sh caught it. A differential harness that misses the
# failure the value suite catches is not adding coverage, and the removal proof
# is what exposed it.
