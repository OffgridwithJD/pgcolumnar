# pgColumnar Hilbert clustering curve battery (issue #889).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
#
# #889 replaces the Z-order clustering key with a Hilbert one. A space-filling
# curve is exactly the kind of code that is easy to get almost right: a wrong
# curve still returns a number for every point, still sorts, still clusters
# something, and still makes a benchmark look better than no clustering at all.
# Nothing downstream of it can tell. So the curve is pinned here, directly, by
# its mathematical properties and by frozen bytes, rather than inferred from a
# query plan or a page count.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS WOULD HAVE CAUGHT
#
# An encoder that truncates, or that mixes up the bit order, is injective on the
# subset anyone happens to sample. It passes a "no collisions" test. It fails
# arm C1 here, which asserts the encoded indices are EXACTLY the contiguous
# range [0, 2^(ncols*b)) -- every value hit once, none left over.
#
# A serpentine (boustrophedon) scan is unit-step adjacent everywhere and is not
# a Hilbert curve: its dyadic sub-cubes are scattered, so a range query over a
# sub-cube reads runs from all over the file. It passes an adjacency test alone.
#
# Z-order -- what ships today -- has perfect dyadic locality and jumps a long
# way at every quadrant boundary. It passes a contiguity test alone.
#
# So neither property alone certifies a Hilbert curve, and the battery is only
# non-vacuous as C2 AND C3 together. Both wrong encoders are compiled and run in
# arm C3 as named controls, and the suite asserts their verdicts explicitly, in
# both directions. If either control ever behaves the way the real encoder
# should, the instrument is broken and this suite says so instead of passing.
#
# A third control encoder, TRUNCATE, exists for C1, which had none: the
# serpentine and Z-order are both permutations, so neither can make the
# permutation checker report a violation, and until TRUNCATE was added nothing
# in this file proved C1 could go red at all.
#
# THE CONTROL ARMS ARE CALIBRATION, NOT COVERAGE. controls.c does not link
# src/columnar_curve.c, by design, and with that file deleted the control arms
# still print PASS. Their names are prefixed INSTRUMENT and the run prints the
# instrument and battery counts separately, so nobody counts them as evidence
# about the encoder.
#
# WHY THIS IS A STANDALONE C BATTERY
#
# The curve is a pure function of ncols uint64 words. It needs no cluster, no
# catalog and no rows, and running it through SQL would put an entire storage
# engine between the assertion and the thing asserted. So the suite writes C to
# a temp directory, compiles it, runs it, and turns the program's output into
# check() arms. test/harness_selftest.sh and test/docs_style.sh are the
# precedent for a suite that skips pgc_setup; test/build_san.sh is the precedent
# for a suite that compiles C.
#
# THE INTERFACE UNDER TEST
#
#	void cluster_hilbert_transpose(uint64 *X, int ncols);
#	void cluster_pack_interleave(const uint64 *ord, int ncols,
#				     unsigned char *out);
#
# The Hilbert key is: ordinals -> transpose -> pack. The Z-order key is:
# ordinals -> pack. Output is exactly 8*ncols bytes, and arm C5 measures that
# rather than trusting it.
#
# cluster_pack_interleave is the interleave loop that lives inside
# cluster_zorder_key in src/columnar_vacuum.c today, moved out unchanged. No
# line number: the four that used to be here rot the moment anything above them
# moves, and the frozen Z-order table is what actually pins the bytes.
# src/columnar_curve.c and src/columnar_curve.h do not exist yet; until they do,
# every arm that needs them is RED, and that is the intended state.
#
# THE ARMS
#
#   C1  Permutation. For ncols 1..8 and every b with ncols*b <= 20, the b-bit
#       coordinates go in the TOP b bits of each uint64. Every one of the
#       2^(ncols*b) points is encoded and the set of indices must be exactly
#       [0, 2^(ncols*b)). 52 cases, 6,344,330 points.
#   C2  Unit-step adjacency. The packed keys are sorted with real memcmp and the
#       sorted walk is compared against the POINT COORDINATES, which the sort
#       cannot manufacture: consecutive points differ in one coordinate by one.
#   C3  Dyadic self-similarity, plus the two named negative controls above.
#   C4  Production-width bridge. (a) The top ncols*b bits of the key for a
#       full-width ordinal vector equal the exhaustively verified index of the
#       sub-cube that vector sits in. (b) An inverse transcribed from Skilling's
#       published TransposetoAxes round-trips random full-width keys, and
#       consecutive keys decode to unit-adjacent points. A round trip against an
#       inverse derived from the forward code proves nothing, so a deliberately
#       mutated inverse is compiled beside it and the arm must go red under it.
#   C5  Golden byte vectors, and the pack bit order and key length.
#   C6  ncols == 1 is the identity, pinned absolutely and relatively.
#   C7  The Z-order refactor is byte-for-byte inert.
#
# WHERE EVERY EXPECTED VALUE CAME FROM
#
# No expected value in this file was produced by the code under test. The code
# under test did not exist when they were written.
#
#  0. WHAT THE GOLDEN VECTORS DISCRIMINATE. "zero", "max" and "topbit0" are
#     structural invariants -- zero survives any permutation of the output bits,
#     max is all-ones so any permutation is identical, and topbit0's single set
#     bit lands in output bit 0 under both interleaved and column-major packing.
#     Measured against a column-major pack, 27 of the C7 arms and 13 of the C5
#     arms still passed. They are kept for the zero and all-ones edges and are
#     not counted as discrimination. "unit", "tie", "mixed", "asym" and "lowbit"
#     are what carry it; "asym" gives every column a different dense value, and
#     "lowbit" puts one set bit in the LAST column's LOWEST position, which is
#     the bit a pack that truncates or reverses column order loses first.
#
#  1. BY HAND, from the two loops:
#     - Every all-zero vector encodes to 8*ncols zero bytes. Skilling's first
#       pass leaves an all-zero X untouched (both branches XOR zero), the Gray
#       encode XORs zeros, and the accumulated mask t is zero. So the key is
#       zero.
#     - At ncols == 1 the transpose is the IDENTITY, so the key is the ordinal
#       big-endian: 0 -> 00.., 1 -> ..01, 2^63 -> 80.., UINT64_MAX -> ff..
#       Pass one XORs, for each set bit from 63 down to 1, the bits below it;
#       pass two accumulates that same mask from the result and XORs it back,
#       and the two cancel. Worked by hand at three bits: 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5,
#       3 -> 2 -> 3, 6 -> 5 -> 6. Arm C6 is what actually pins it.
#     - The pack bit order. The loop emits ord[0].bit63, ord[1].bit63, ...,
#       ord[n-1].bit63, ord[0].bit62, ... MSB first. So with ncols == 2,
#       pack(2^63, 0) puts a 1 in output bit 0 and pack(0, 2^63) puts it in
#       output bit 1: the keys must start 0x80 and 0x40.
#     - Every key is 8*ncols bytes, because the loop writes 64*ncols bits.
#
#  2. FROM SKILLING, NOT FROM US, for the remaining Hilbert keys. Generated on
#     2026-09-08 from an independent transcription of AxestoTranspose at b = 64
#     -- John Skilling, "Programming the Hilbert curve", AIP Conf. Proc. 707,
#     381-387 (2004) -- run once, off-tree, and pasted in as literals. That
#     transcription was checked before its output was trusted: it round-tripped
#     160,000 random full-width transposes against a separate transcription of
#     the published TransposetoAxes with 0 mismatches, and it passed C1, C2 and
#     C3 over all 52 cases with 0 violations.
#
#     This arm is the only one that pins WHICH Hilbert curve was chosen.
#     Skilling's curve differs from Butz/Hamilton for ncols >= 3 and both are
#     valid Hilbert curves, so the property arms cannot tell them apart. A
#     transcription bug here would be frozen into the goldens -- which is why C1
#     to C4 exist and do not read this table.
#
#  3. FROM THE CODE BEING REPLACED, for arm C7. The Z-order keys were produced
#     by transcribing the interleave loop out of cluster_zorder_key in
#     src/columnar_vacuum.c verbatim and running it, on 2026-09-08, at commit
#     e84a5e5, BEFORE any refactor. They are a frozen record. If both sides of C7
#     ever call the same new function the arm is a tautology; it compares new
#     code against these bytes and must keep doing so.
#
#     The control program's own ctl_pack is held to this SAME table, so "the
#     control packs the way the product packs" is an arm rather than a comment.
#     It was a comment, and nothing could falsify it: a Z-order over reversed
#     columns -- not what ships -- left all seven control arms green.
#
# WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED
#
# C1, C2 and C3 are exhaustive only up to ncols*b <= 20. Above that the evidence
# is C4's bridge to production width and C5's frozen bytes, not exhaustion.
# Nothing here measures clustering QUALITY: a correct curve that nothing calls
# would pass every arm in this file.
#
# C1 to C3 read only the TOP ncols*b bits of the key -- at most 20 of them. The
# low bits are the file's blind spot and C4b is what covers them, so C4b's
# sample size is load-bearing rather than incidental. It was not, once: the keys
# came from the low byte of a 32-bit LCG whose period there is 512, giving 344
# distinct keys where the premise arm certified 24,000, and a correct Skilling
# transpose carrying one extra bit-flip on a condition those keys never met was
# compiled against this suite and reported "138 passed + 0 failed". C4b now
# draws from splitmix64 and asserts the DISTINCT keys it round-tripped. A pack
# that ignores the low 32 bits of every ordinal is a cruder form of the same
# blind spot: it passes C1, C2, C3, C4a and both C5 extent arms, and is caught
# only by the goldens, C7, the C5 content arm, two of the C6 pins and C4b.
#
# C7 pins the PACKING of ordinals that are handed to it. cluster_zorder_key also
# derives those ordinals (cluster_type_ordinal) and maps NULL to 0, and nothing
# here calls cluster_zorder_key, so a refactor that moved the ordinal derivation
# or changed the NULL rule stays green. The arm is named for the pack, not for
# the key.
#
# THE PARAGRAPH THAT STOOD HERE WAS CARRIED OUT AND LEFT BEHIND (#1088). It made
# three claims, each true when written and none true now:
#
#     "NOT REGISTERED in test/run_all_versions.sh"   it is registered
#     "src/columnar_curve.c does not exist"          127 lines, and it links
#                                                    into pgcolumnar.so
#     "070 reports it as UNREGISTERED, which is
#      the accurate state"                           070's arm PASSES: every
#                                                    suite is registered
#
# It also said registering the suite "belongs in the commit that adds the
# encoder". That commit landed. A stale instruction is worse than a stale fact
# because it tells the next person to undo what was done, and this one names the
# undo explicitly.
#
# Usage:  test/hilbert_curve.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# The argument is accepted and ignored; this suite needs no cluster.
# Environment:
#   CC                 the compiler to use; smoke-tested before it is believed.
#   PGC_KEEP_WORKDIR   non-empty keeps the temp directory holding the generated
#                      C, the build logs and the two programs' output, for
#                      anyone reproducing an arm by hand. Local to this suite.
