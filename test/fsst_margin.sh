# The FSST keep/drop cost margin (#155, #271).
#
# PgColumnarFsstHelpsCompressed used to keep FSST on any compressed win at all,
# however small, and the per-vector FSST encode is a dominant cost of a text or
# varlena load. pgcolumnar.fsst_min_gain_percent requires the win to clear a
# margin before FSST is kept.
#
# The knob changes how bytes are encoded, so the check that matters is not that
# it saves time -- that is a benchmark, and benchmarks belong elsewhere -- but
# that it never changes what comes back out. A future change to the FSST path
# could otherwise alter content under a non-default margin with nothing to catch
# it.
#
# It asserts:
#   1. the margin actually decides -- a corpus whose FSST win is marginal keeps
#      FSST below the margin and drops it above, observed from the encoding
#      descriptor rather than inferred from size;
#   2. margin 0 is the original "any win keeps it", so the documented equivalence
#      is pinned rather than argued from the arithmetic;
#   3. the rows read back byte-identical at every margin, including against a
#      heap mirror. This is the invariant; 1 and 2 exist to prove 3 is not
#      vacuous.
#
# Usage:  test/fsst_margin.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# --- 1. the margin decides ---------------------------------------------------
#
# THE THREE ARMS BELOW AND IN 2b BRACKET THE DECISION, and the bracket also
# falsifies `fsst_vectors` itself. That second property is accidental and worth
# writing down, because the low-margin arm looks redundant next to the margin-90
# one and is not:
#
#     reader always returns 0    low-margin RED   margin-90 PASS   codec RED
#     reader always returns >0   low-margin PASS  margin-90 RED    codec PASS
#     the real tree              PASS             PASS             PASS
#
# `fsst_vectors` parses the encoding descriptor by byte offset --
# `get_byte(descriptor, 6 + i * 13)` -- which is exactly the kind of reader that
# goes silently wrong on a format change and reports a plausible number. With only
# the margin-90 arm, a reader stuck at 0 would read as "FSST was dropped" and every
# arm would be green. Removing the low-margin arm as redundant takes that with it.
#
# AND THE TWO MARGINS ARE THE GUC'S OWN ENDPOINTS, not arbitrary low and high
# values. `columnar_tableam.c:3269` declares it `5, 0, 99` -- default 5, minimum
# 0, maximum 99 -- so this arm and 2b's bracket the decision with the extremes the
# setting admits.
#
# That is what makes each half the strongest available statement. At margin 0 the
# keep test is "any compressed win at all keeps FSST", in the GUC's own words, so
# `kept == 0` here would mean FSST never helps on this corpus rather than merely
# not helping enough. Raise this to 5 to "simplify" it and that disappears, with
# nothing to show it went.
#
# Found by @OffgridwithJD reviewing #1082, and the endpoint reading is theirs too.
# The table above is measured rather than argued, by evaluating the arms against a
# stubbed reader; the range was read from the declaration rather than taken on
# trust.

# --- 2b. the CODEC decides too, which the docs used to deny (#1076) ----------
#
# `pgcolumnar.compression` reads as a codec choice: "default codec for new
# chunks". It is not only that. `columnar_encoding.c` returns "FSST helps"
# UNCONDITIONALLY when the codec is `none`, before it looks at the corpus or the
# margin:
#
#     if (compressionType == COLUMNAR_COMPRESSION_NONE)
#         return true;
#
# So `none` is not "the cascade without a block codec", it is a DIFFERENT
# cascade. Setting it changes which lightweight encodings a chunk gets.
#
# This is the same differential as section 1 with the other variable moved: same
# corpus, same margin 90, and only the codec differs. Section 1 established that
# margin 90 drops FSST on this corpus, so a keep here can only have come from the
# codec. Without that pairing this arm would be satisfied by a corpus FSST always
# wins on.

# could drop FSST under `none` this is the one that would.
