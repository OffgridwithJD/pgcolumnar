# pgColumnar: the FSST keep/drop verdict is cached with an age bound (#472).
#
# pgcolumnar_flush_row_group decides FSST keep/drop once per column per row
# group, and the decision cannot use a sample: on a training prefix FSST can
# look 24% worse while over the whole column it is 23% better, an inversion no
# margin would make safe. So PgColumnarFsstHelpsCompressed FSST-encodes the
# whole corpus and compresses it, only to answer yes or no. For a column whose
# data does not change character, that recomputes the same answer for every row
# group of the load.
#
# Measured on main before this change, 2,000,000 rows in 20 row groups: 2482 ms
# of a 5319 ms md5 load and 843 ms of a 2081 ms email load went to deciding, and
# the verdict was the same all 20 times. 41 to 47 percent of a text load
# re-deriving a constant.
#
# THE RISK IS NOT SPEED, IT IS SILENCE. A stale verdict does not corrupt
# anything; it compresses worse, correctly, and nothing would notice. So the
# headline checks here are byte equality of the stored chunks, not load time.
#
# Usage:  test/fsst_verdict_cache.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
