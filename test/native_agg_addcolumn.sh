# pgColumnar metadata aggregates over a column added by ALTER TABLE.
#
# An ungrouped, unfiltered aggregate is answered from row group metadata. A
# column added by ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN has no chunk, and so no zone map, in any
# row group written before it existed: its value for those rows is the
# attribute's missing value, which the reader supplies through getmissingattr and
# a zone map cannot describe at all.
#
# Folding such a group from its zone maps dropped every one of those rows in
# silence. On main before the fix, over 3,000 rows and a column added with
# DEFAULT 7:
#
#     count(d)  0     against 3000 from a scan
#     sum(d)    null  against 21000
#     min(d)    null  against 7
#
# No error, and the scan path disagreed with the metadata path on the same query,
# which is the shape this project treats as the worst kind of defect.
#
# The oracle throughout is the same query with pgcolumnar.enable_vectorization
# off, which reads the rows. Comparing the two paths against each other is
# stronger than comparing either to a hand-computed value: it is the property
# that has to hold, and it holds whatever the data is.
#
# Usage:  test/native_agg_addcolumn.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# Both paths must agree; the scan path is the oracle.

# "SELECT (count(d))::text", and the cast is enough to stop the planner choosing
# the metadata path at all -- so both sides fell back to a scan, agreed with each
# other, and the suite passed against the unfixed build. Anything wrapped around
# the aggregate here silently turns this file into a test of nothing.
