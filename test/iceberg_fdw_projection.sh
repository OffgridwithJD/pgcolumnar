# Regression: the Iceberg FDW pushes projection down (decodes only the columns a
# query references), and doing so must not change results. The reader already
# supports a needTop mask; this asserts the FDW passes it correctly by comparing
# every projection shape against bare iceberg_scan (which reads all columns).
#
# The performance win itself (a narrow projection over a wide table decodes far
# fewer columns) is not asserted here because timing is environment-dependent; it
# was measured out of band (a 1-of-40-column scan ran ~5x faster than the same
# query before the pushdown). This suite pins the CORRECTNESS of the pushdown.
