# pgColumnar foreign keys that reference a columnar table.
#
# Referential integrity reads the referenced row with FOR KEY SHARE, to hold the
# parent key still until the referencing transaction ends. Row locking is not
# implemented for columnar tables, so that read raises.
#
# Before this was refused at DDL, the constraint was accepted and then every
# insert into the referencing table failed, including inserts that satisfied it:
#
#     CREATE TABLE parent (id int PRIMARY KEY) USING pgcolumnar;
#     INSERT INTO parent VALUES (1);
#     CREATE TABLE child (id int REFERENCES parent(id));   -- accepted
#     INSERT INTO child VALUES (1);                        -- parent row exists
#     ERROR:  columnar: row locking is not supported yet
#
# A table that can never be written to is worse than a constraint that is
# refused, and the refusal belongs where the configuration is chosen. Core does
# the same for an unlogged table under a foreign key: it fails at CREATE TABLE
# rather than at every INSERT.
#
# The direction matters and is the reason this file is not one check. Only the
# REFERENCED side is refused. Columnar on the REFERENCING side reads a heap
# parent and writes its own rows through the ordinary insert path, so it works
# and must keep working -- a fix that rejected both directions would take away
# something that does.
#
# There are two ways into that configuration and the file covers both. Creating
# the constraint against a columnar table is one; making an already-referenced
# table columnar is the other, and it reaches the identical dead end from the
# opposite side (sections 5 and 6). The second is refused at
# ALTER TABLE ... SET ACCESS METHOD, so the controls there are about not
# over-reaching: an unrelated ALTER TABLE on a referenced table, a conversion of
# the referencing side, and a conversion of a table with no foreign key at all
# must all still work.
#
# Usage:  test/fk_referencing.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# ordinary partition creation is then refused -- by an error naming the partition
# the user just wrote, saying nothing about the ALTER that caused it.
#
# The routes that were already covered are asserted first, because they are what
# makes this a small gap rather than a trap: the constraint-side check fires on
# the cloned constraint, so a columnar partition is refused however it arrives.
