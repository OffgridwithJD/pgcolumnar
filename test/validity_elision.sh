# A column with no nulls must not store a validity bitmap (#1130).
#
# flush_one_column builds the page as [validity][finalData]
# (columnar_write_state.c:1079). The bitmap is one bit per row, allocated
# unconditionally (:1107) and appended raw (:1156) BEFORE the block codec runs
# (:1479), which therefore never sees it. A NOT NULL column, or one that simply
# holds no nulls, still writes ceil(rows/8) bytes of 0xFF.
#
# Measured on ClickBench hits_0.parquet -- 1,000,000 rows, 105 columns, no nulls
# in any of them -- the bitmap was 16.03% of the stored table, and 16.80% after
# #1132 shrank the values around it. On a column that encodes well it dominates:
# on a sorted bigint it was 99.5% of the page.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT IS EXACT, not a ratio, which is why this suite can assert a
# number rather than a threshold. With no block codec the page is exactly
# [validity][encoded], so
#
#     page_length - sum(encLen over the chunk's vectors)
#
# IS the validity size, with nothing else in it. Verified on eight chunks across
# four corpora before this change: residual 0 on every one. So the arm reads 0
# for an elided bitmap and ceil(rows/8) for a present one, and a wrong answer
# cannot hide inside a tolerance.
#
# It asserts:
#   1. the two fixtures are what they claim -- one holds no nulls, the other
#      holds some -- because the arms below are about that difference;
#   2. a column with no nulls stores no bitmap at all;
#   3. a column WITH nulls still stores one. This is the silent direction:
#      deleting the bitmap unconditionally satisfies 2 and loses every null;
#   4. both columns read back exactly what the heap holds, NULLs included;
#   5. and they read back the same through the FETCH path, which is a second
#      reader with its own copy of the layout. The elided chunk is the one most
#      likely to land there: the coalesced read skips a chunk smaller than the
#      group's bitmap, and eliding the bitmap is what takes it below that.
