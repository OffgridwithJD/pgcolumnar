# REPACK on a columnar table (issue #399). PostgreSQL 19 and later only.
#
# REPACK replaces CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL in 19. It is not a new table-AM
# callback: it reuses the CLUSTER machinery, which dispatches a rewrite through
# relation_copy_for_cluster. design/PG18_19_OPPORTUNITIES.md concluded from that
# dispatch that REPACK "should work" on a columnar table, because pgColumnar
# registers that callback.
#
# It does not work. The callback is registered and is a stub that raises, so the
# reasoning was true of the symbol and false of the behaviour. That is the gap a
# suite closes and a grep does not, and it is why this file exists.
#
# What is asserted here is therefore the ACTUAL behaviour, not the hoped-for one:
# every spelling of the command errors, it errors naming the command the user
# typed, the table is unharmed afterwards, and the supported alternative works.
# If someone later implements relation_copy_for_cluster, these checks fail and
# should be rewritten to assert success. That is the intended signal.
#
# The heap control is not decoration. Without it, "REPACK fails here" cannot be
# told apart from "REPACK does not work on this build at all".
#
# REPACK (CONCURRENTLY) needs two fixtures for the same reason, and the first
# version of this suite got it wrong. Without an identity index both access
# methods are refused before the AM is reached, so asserting that failure alone
# passes for a reason that has nothing to do with us, and would keep passing if
# our behaviour changed. With a primary key and wal_level=logical, heap succeeds
# and columnar raises our error, so the concurrent form IS a columnar behaviour.
#
# Usage:  test/native_repack.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# The concurrent form has a precondition: the relation needs an identity index. On
# a table without one BOTH access methods fail, and the failure says so. Asserting
# only that is a trap, because the assertion passes for the wrong reason and would
# keep passing if the columnar behaviour changed. It is kept below, labelled as
# what it is, and paired with a fixture that MEETS the precondition.
# The distinction is the assertion: without an identity index the error is
# PostgreSQL's own precondition ("cannot execute REPACK (CONCURRENTLY) on
# relation"), raised before the access method is consulted. With one, below, the
# error is ours. Two different failures that a single "it errors" check would
# conflate.
