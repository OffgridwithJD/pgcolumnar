#
# pgColumnar: a stripe flush opens each metadata table ONCE, not once per row (#445).
#
# The four metadata inserters (row_group, column_chunk, zone_map, bloom) each
# used to open their catalog, insert one row, and close. A flush inserts a chunk
# row per column and about one zone row per vector per column, so it opened a
# metadata relation on the order of natts * vectors times, and a profile of the
# numeric write path put that open and close cycle, not the encoding, at the top.
# A per-flush session now caches each metadata relation and reuses it for the
# whole flush.
#
# The witness is the DEBUG1 line the flush emits once per stripe:
#   "pgcolumnar metadata flush: opens=N tables=M"
# where N is the number of REAL relation opens during the flush.
#
# This suite pins the property that is the whole point: the open count is a small
# constant, and it does NOT grow with the column count. That equality IS the
# removal proof. Revert the reuse (make open_columnar_table always table_open, or
# drop the session bracket in the flush) and the wide flush opens far more
# relations than the narrow one, so the "same for narrow and wide" check goes RED
# on its own, with no mutation needed. The absolute-bound and heap-mirror checks
# fence it further.
#
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
