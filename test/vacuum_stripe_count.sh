# pgColumnar: pgcolumnar.vacuum's stripe_count is refused, not silently ignored (#560).
#
# docs/sql-reference.md documented `stripe_count` as bounding how many row groups
# are combined in one call. The C function reads PG_GETARG_OID(0) and nothing
# else, and passes a literal 0 to pgcolumnar_compact_relation, so the argument
# has never done anything.
#
# HONOURING IT IS NOT AN OPTION, and that is the whole reason this fix refuses
# rather than implements. pgcolumnar_compact_relation's second parameter is
# nsortkeys, not a bound, and its body dereferences sortAtts[i]. More seriously,
# it swaps the whole relation to a NEW RELFILENODE, so a partial rewrite of some
# row groups would leave the rest behind and destroy them. A bounded compaction
# is a different algorithm, not a parameter.
#
# pgcolumnar.compact_rewrite(rel, min_deleted_fraction, max_groups) already does
# bounded work: its maxGroups reaches pgcolumnar_rewrite_partial_groups. So the
# refusal can name a function that actually works, which is what makes an ERROR
# defensible rather than merely honest.
#
# vacuum_full carries the same argument and PASSES IT THROUGH to
# pgcolumnar.vacuum, so it inherits the refusal without its own change. That
# propagation is asserted here, because it is the only thing making the second
# instance safe.
#
# Usage:  test/vacuum_stripe_count.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
