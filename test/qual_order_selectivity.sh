# pgColumnar: chunk-group skip predicates are evaluated most-selective-first, so
# a group that is going to be thrown away is not probed through every other
# predicate's column on the way there (#403 item 4).
#
# The group-skip loop returns "cannot match" on the FIRST predicate that excludes,
# and each predicate's first use in a group fetches that column's zone map from
# the catalog. Which predicate is tried first therefore decides how many catalog
# probes a pruned group costs.
#
# The order the loop used was the order the ScanKeys arrived in, which is
# ATTRIBUTE order. Measured on 100 row groups with two predicates, one excluding
# 99 groups and one excluding none:
#
#     WHERE a >= 0 AND b = 42     200 probes
#     WHERE b = 42 AND a >= 0     200 probes
#
# Both, because writing the selective predicate first in the query does not put
# it first in the ScanKeys. The order was arbitrary with respect to selectivity,
# not merely suboptimal.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT BREAK. The predicates are a conjunction, so the result does
# not depend on the order, and the groups-removed count is the same either way.
# That is why this suite pins the PROBES: no correctness check can see this
# change, and the groups-removed line cannot either. The answer arms below are
# still here, because a reordering bug that dropped a predicate would show up
# nowhere else.
