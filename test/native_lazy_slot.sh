# pgColumnar deferred column decode on the index fetch path (issue #157).
#
# An index fetch used to reconstruct every column of the row before returning it,
# because a virtual slot holds values and nothing else. On a wide table that is
# not merely wasteful: the decoded row group exceeds the fetch cache's size cap,
# the entry is dropped after every fetch, and each row re-reads and re-decodes the
# whole group. 2,000 fetches of one column from a 41-column table took minutes.
#
# The executor never says which columns it will read, but it does ask, through
# slot_getsomeattrs, for the smallest prefix it needs. So the slot now carries the
# row's address and decodes when asked.
#
# The risk is entirely correctness, and it is the quiet kind: a slot that decodes
# too few columns hands back a stale or empty value with nothing raised. So the
# timing check is last and everything before it is differential against a heap
# table holding the same rows.
#
# Four things are asserted.
#
# 1. Values are right through an index scan, for every column position and for
#    the shapes that decide how much gets decoded: the first column, the last,
#    one in the middle, all of them, and none of them (count(*)).
#
# 2. Values are right when the row has never been flushed, which takes the
#    buffered path instead and is stored eagerly.
#
# 3. The paths that need a whole row still get one: materialising, sorting,
#    copying into another table, and forming a heap tuple.
#
# 4. The cliff is gone, as a ratio between column counts on the same machine.
#
# Usage:  test/native_lazy_slot.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
