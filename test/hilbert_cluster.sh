# pgColumnar Hilbert clustering: the SQL surface, the recorded kind, the
# self-gate and the daemon (issue #889, SQL half).
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
#
# test/hilbert_curve.sh pins the CURVE, in C, by its mathematical properties and
# by frozen bytes. Nothing in it goes through SQL, so nothing in it can tell
# whether the curve is ever REACHED from a user statement, whether the table
# remembers that it was laid on that curve, or whether the maintenance daemon
# preserves the choice. This file is that half and only that half; it does not
# re-test the encoder.
#
# THE SURFACE, AND WHY IT IS TWO NEW VERBS RATHER THAN A PARAMETER
#
#	pgcolumnar.cluster_hilbert(regclass, VARIADIC name[])
#	pgcolumnar.recluster_hilbert(regclass, VARIADIC name[])
#
# PostgreSQL refuses to extend the existing signature in either direction: a
# defaulted parameter cannot precede a VARIADIC one, and VARIADIC must be last.
# An array-plus-kind overload breaks the documented cluster('t','a','b') call
# style with "function ... is not unique". Both measured on 18.4. The surface is
# settled; these arms pin it rather than reopen it.
#
# THE OWNER RULING (2026-09-09, recorded on #889): THE CURVE IS STICKY
#
# sorted_kind is the table's DECLARED INTENT, not a property of each call:
#
#	- the daemon dispatches on the recorded kind, so a Hilbert table stays
#	  Hilbert;
#	- plain recluster() on a Hilbert table WITH A MATCHING KEY is a no-op, not
#	  a silent conversion to Z-order;
#	- switching curves requires naming the other verb explicitly;
#	- vacuum_sorted must not clobber a Hilbert table. Its gate
#	  (vacuum_sorted_gate_is_noop, src/columnar_vacuum.c) refuses anything that
#	  is not exactly 'lexicographic', so TODAY it would rewrite the table and
#	  relabel it.
#
# S6 IS THE ONE ARM WHOSE INTENDED VALUE IS A READING RATHER THAN A QUOTE. The
# ruling says vacuum_sorted "must not clobber"; it does not say in so many words
# whether the correct behaviour is a no-op or an honest relabel. This suite pins
# the no-op, because the parenthetical names "rewrite AND relabel" as the defect
# and a relabel alone is honest labelling. If the owner meant the other thing,
# S6 is the arm to change and it is deliberately isolated so that it can be.
#
# WHY EACH ARM IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
#
#	- SQLSTATE, never message text. A grep for "permission denied" is also
#	  satisfied by a login FATAL, a missing function (42883), a bad argument
#	  (22023) or a transaction-block refusal (25001). Only aclcheck_error
#	  produces 42501, and a role that cannot open a session carries no SQLSTATE
#	  at all -- so the session premise is asserted first.
#	- AND "no error" MUST MEAN THE SERVER ANSWERED. sqlstate() reports a state
#	  only when it finds one, so a probe that never reached the server used to
#	  read as success and satisfied its own removal proof. Every probe now
#	  carries a sentinel statement behind the one under test: no sentinel in the
#	  output is PROBE_UNREACHABLE, not noerror, and a NOLOGIN role proves the
#	  probe can still say so.
#	- A CALL MADE WITH psql_run IS NOT AN ASSERTION. This suite runs under
#	  `set -uo pipefail` with no -e, so a verb that RAISES leaves no trace: the
#	  fixture is simply not rewritten, and "the verb left the table alone" is
#	  byte-identical to "the verb threw". A vacuum_sorted that raises on every
#	  Hilbert table scored as the pinned no-op and all of S6 went green
#	  (measured, 2026-09-09). So every maintenance verb here is called through
#	  hrun(), which asserts the SQLSTATE, or through q(), whose empty result on
#	  an error is rejected by check_num.
#	- pgc_set_hash IS ORDER-BLIND BY DESIGN. A parity-only "it only reorders"
#	  arm therefore passes on a table nothing touched, so S2 carries the
#	  order-SENSITIVE half beside it and neither half stands alone.
#	- AND AN "IT MOVED" ARM MUST NOT BE SATISFIED BY A MEASUREMENT NOBODY TOOK.
#	  pgc_seq_hash returns a unique QUERY_ERROR.$seq when its query cannot run
#	  and EMPTY when the relation has no rows; physlayout returns NO_LAYOUT when
#	  the relation has no stripes. Those sentinels stop two FAILED measurements
#	  comparing EQUAL (#418) -- and they are unequal to every baseline, so they
#	  satisfy an inequality arm outright. Thirteen arms were of that shape; all
#	  of them now go through changed()/differs(), which report UNMEASURED rather
#	  than "moved" when either side is a sentinel.
#	- physlayout() IS BLIND TO AN EAGER REWRITE, AND THAT IS MEASURED HERE
#	  RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The eager verbs (cluster, cluster_hilbert,
#	  vacuum_sorted) swap the relfilenode and rewrite into a fresh file, so the
#	  (stripeid, fileoffset, rowcount) multiset comes back byte-identical: at
#	  20 stripes and at 1, vacuum_sorted and cluster both left the digest
#	  unchanged while the row order moved (measured on PG17.10, 2026-09-08).
#	  So physlayout is the right corroboration for the ONLINE recluster gate,
#	  where retired groups and new file offsets do move it -- and it is the
#	  WRONG instrument for S2 and S6, which use the order digest and carry a
#	  control that pins this blindness on a verb that exists today.
#	- A RETURN OF 0 IS NOT EVIDENCE THE GATE FIRED, AND NEITHER IS AN UNCHANGED
#	  LAYOUT BESIDE IT. Both are the same observation -- nothing happened -- and
#	  "the function does not exist" is the strongest instance of it: with the
#	  verb absent, "the physical layout is byte-identical, so the gate fired"
#	  printed PASS, and so did all three arms of (a) against a stub defined as
#	  `BEGIN RETURN 0; END` (both measured, 2026-09-09). A gate is proved by a
#	  POSITIVE CONTROL ON THE SAME TABLE: S4(a) appends a tail to the very table
#	  that was just gated, requires the SAME call to do work, and then requires
#	  the gate to close again. "This verb can rewrite this table and chose not
#	  to" is what "the gate fired" means; nothing weaker distinguishes a gate
#	  from a dead verb.
#	- S7 DRIVES THE DAEMON. Calling recluster() by hand and reasoning about
#	  what the daemon would do answers the neighbouring question. The daemon
#	  hard-codes its recluster call at src/columnar_autovacuum.c:283-291, and
#	  that line is the subject of the ruling, so the daemon has to run.
#	- AND THE DAEMON'S REFERENCE MUST BE FROZEN WHILE IT RUNS. "av_hi came to
#	  match the hand-driven hilbert twin" is also satisfied by the daemon
#	  reclustering the TWIN, which is what happened when a stubbed
#	  recluster_hilbert left the twin's tail unfolded and therefore due
#	  (measured). The twin's digest and appended count are captured before the
#	  daemon is enabled and asserted unchanged after, and the daemon's own LOG
#	  LINE names the dispatch, so the actor is read rather than inferred.
#
# WHAT DEFENDS THE CURVE, AND WHAT DOES NOT
#
# There is no SQL exposure of cluster_hilbert_transpose, so no arm here can
# compare a verb's output against the pinned encoder; that would need a
# test-only SQL helper in the install script, which is #889's own change to
# make. What this suite CAN do is refuse to accept a relabelled Z-order
# implementation, and four arms carry that and no others:
#
#	S3  "three different physical orders (hilbert vs zorder)" -- the EAGER verb
#	S4  "(d) ... is NOT the ZORDER rewrite over (b,a)"        -- the ONLINE verb
#	S7  "premise: the two references really are two different layouts"
#	S7  "and it is NOT the zorder layout"                     -- the DAEMON
#
# Measured on PG17.10, 2026-09-09, against a shim whose two verbs delegate to
# the Z-order verbs and then write sorted_kind='hilbert': exactly those four
# reddened for the curve, and 162 of 181 arms passed. S5 in particular is fully
# green on such a shim BY CONSTRUCTION -- over one column both curves are the
# identity -- so S5 buys the surface and the recorded identity, never the curve,
# and must not be counted as evidence of Hilbertness.
#
# THE THREE PARAGRAPHS THAT STOOD HERE WERE CARRIED OUT AND LEFT BEHIND (#1043).
# They said this suite was red on purpose, that neither verb existed, and that it
# was deliberately absent from the matrix. All three were true when written. The
# commit they named, `4b66555`, did every one of the things they instructed, and
# the paragraphs stayed:
#
#     cluster_hilbert, recluster_hilbert   defined in the install script
#     registered                           test/run_all_versions.sh
#     green                                in the matrix, on all five majors
#
# So a reader was told the suite is red on purpose, and it is green; that the
# verbs do not exist, and they ship; and that registering it is future work, and
# it is registered. A stale instruction is worse than a stale fact, because it
# tells the next person to undo what was done.
#
# WHAT SURVIVES IS THE ONE SENTENCE THAT IS STILL TRUE, and it is the trap the
# original paragraphs existed to name: a shim that renames the Z-order verbs and
# writes sorted_kind='hilbert' reddens only four arms and passes 162 of 181. S5
# is green on such a shim BY CONSTRUCTION, because over one column both curves
# are the identity. S5 therefore buys the surface and the recorded identity, and
# never the curve. Do not count it as evidence of Hilbertness.

# for the ONLINE gate in S4. It cannot see an EAGER rewrite: the eager path
# writes a fresh file and reproduces the same (stripeid, fileoffset, rowcount)
# multiset, so the digest is byte-identical either side of a rewrite that
# reordered every row. Measured on plain cluster() below rather than asserted
# about cluster_hilbert(), so the control stands on code that ships today and
# cannot be perturbed by whatever #889 lands.
#
# WHAT THIS SECTION NO LONGER ASSERTS, AND WHY. It used to also require s2c's
# OWN layout digest to be unchanged across cluster_hilbert. That is not a
# property of the eager path; file_offset is the compressed size of the
# preceding groups, so reproducing the geometry is a data-dependent accident of
# this fixture. A correct Hilbert implementation that packs groups differently
# would redden it for no defect. The control below is the honest form of the
# same fact, because it is measured on a verb #889 cannot change.

# =============================================================================
#
# This is the arm the ruling exists for, so it DRIVES THE DAEMON. The daemon
# builds its own call at src/columnar_autovacuum.c:283-291 and hard-codes
# pgcolumnar.recluster; calling recluster() from the suite and reasoning about
# it would measure the neighbouring question.
#
# Three twins from one fixture, with identical appended decay:
#
#	av_hi   hilbert, left decayed -- the DAEMON's subject
#	av_ref  hilbert, reclustered BY HAND with recluster_hilbert -- what a
#	        Hilbert rewrite of this data produces
#	av_zo   zorder,  reclustered BY HAND with recluster -- the control that
#	        makes "the layout is a Hilbert layout" a discrimination rather
#	        than a restatement of "something ran"
#
# The two hand-driven twins are reclustered BEFORE the daemon is enabled, so
# they have no appended tail left and the daemon has no reason to touch them.
# THAT IS A PREMISE, NOT A GUARANTEE: when recluster_hilbert was a stub, av_ref
# kept its tail, stayed due, and the daemon reclustered IT as well -- the two
# converged on the same Z-order layout and "av_hi matches the hilbert twin"
# passed on it (measured). So both references are FROZEN across the daemon
# window and asserted unchanged afterwards.
#
# AND THE DAEMON HAS TWO DISPATCHES. compact_rewrite would also fold the tail,
# and it records 'zorder' (src/columnar_vacuum.c:1576), so "the tail folded"
# alone cannot name which one ran. compact_rewrite_due is asserted false, and
# the daemon's own log line is read for the dispatch that did the work.
