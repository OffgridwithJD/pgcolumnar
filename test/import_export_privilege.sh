# pgColumnar: import/export functions check table privilege, not only the
# server-file role (#559), and get_storage_id checks it too (#566).
#
# The four serial import/export functions gated on pg_read_server_files /
# pg_write_server_files and then checked NO privilege on the relation they read
# or wrote. So pg_read_server_files conferred INSERT on every columnar table and
# pg_write_server_files conferred SELECT on every one, exfiltrated to a file. The
# parallel twins (parallel_copy, parallel_export_parquet) already checked it; the
# serial four did not. get_storage_id returned an internal storage id of any
# relation to a role with only schema USAGE.
#
# LAYER ISOLATION is the whole point of the role setup. These functions have
# three refusers BEFORE the new table check: the pgcolumnar schema USAGE, the
# EXECUTE grant on the function, and the server-file role. A test role missing
# any of those is refused for a reason that is not the table ACL, and a total
# removal of the new check would still read as "refused". So the attacker role
# here holds ALL THREE outer layers and NO privilege on the target table -- the
# only configuration in which the new pg_class_aclcheck is the sole thing that
# can refuse. Verified by removal: deleting the five aclcheck blocks makes every
# makes every deny arm below report "allowed" (the leak), not a different error.
#
# The refusal is matched on "permission denied for table", which only
# aclcheck_error emits, and allow arms prove the owner is not broken by the fix.
#
# Usage:  test/import_export_privilege.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar. Sibling of test/server_file_privilege.sh.
