# The cost model must describe the geometry a table WAS WRITTEN WITH, not the
# geometry a write in the planning session would produce (#806).
#
# pgcolumnar.storage.row_group_limit records what the writer used. Nothing read
# it: the index-fetch penalty called pgcolumnar_effective_stripe_row_limit(),
# which returns the per-table option or else the PLANNING SESSION's GUC. So a
# session that set pgcolumnar.stripe_row_limit -- before a bulk load, say --
# repriced every columnar table it then planned against, including tables it had
# never touched.
#
# Measured on the same unchanged table, three row groups, written at the
# default, varying only the GUC at plan time:
#
#     plan-time stripe_row_limit    before      after
#              150000               775.26     775.28
#               20000               113.26     775.28
#                5000                36.26     775.28
#
# A 21x swing on a table that did not change. That is the shape of this suite's
# first check, and it needs no bound: the costs must be EQUAL.
#
# WHY THE SWEEP STOPS AT 20000 AND NOT LOWER. The penalty is one of two places
# the session GUC reached. The other is pgcolumnar_zonemap_survival, which uses
# it to guess how many groups exist and is NOT changed here -- substituting the
# written geometry there moved native_zonemap_narrow from wide=30/narrow=30 zone
# map reads to wide=570/narrow=66, reads that scale with table width, which is
# the property that suite exists to hold. So this change fixes the penalty and
# leaves the survival estimate, and a plan-time limit far enough below the
# written one still flips the plan through that second path: at 5000 the same
# table costs 87.79 rather than 775.07, because it stops being an index scan.
#
# That residual is real and is filed rather than hidden. This suite asserts what
# this change actually fixes; it would be dishonest to sweep a range the change
# does not cover and dishonest to pretend the range it does cover is the whole
# defect.
#
# These are planner costs, not timings, so this suite is not a timing suite and
# PGC_SKIP_TIMING does not apply to it (#787).
