# Index-fetch I/O is one ReadLogicalData per column (validity, then the value
# stream). The scan path already coalesces adjacent chunk ranges into one read.
# Adjacent columns are laid out back to back, so a wide fetch of a small group
# is many pins of the same pages rather than one walk.
#
# Public seam: EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) pin count (shared hit+read) after a
# warmup, with the index path forced. The property is the COUNT, not wall
# clock, so it is not subject to PGC_SKIP_TIMING.
#
# Independent of test/pytest/test_native_fetch_coalesce.py: same public seam,
# own fixture, own observations.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fetch_coalesce.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# ---- the validity copy must be bounded by the chunk, not by the row count -----
#
# THIS IS AN ORDERING PIN AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BEHAVIOURAL. The defect it
# guards was a heap overread: the coalesced path copies validityBytes out of a
# span buffer that is only guaranteed to hold page_length bytes for this chunk,
# and the test reconciling the two used to run three lines AFTER the copy.
#
# Reproduced before the fix, on a build with -fsanitize=address, by poisoning
# pgcolumnar.column_chunk.page_length below the validity bitmap on the last
# chunk by page_offset and issuing a plain index-scan SELECT:
#
#     AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow
#     READ of size 625, 0 bytes after a 2640-byte region
#       pgcolumnar_fetch_coalesce_read  columnar_reader.c   (the memcpy)
#       pgcolumnar_fetch_row
#       printtup
#
# A behavioural arm here would be VACUOUS on this build. Reading ~117 bytes past
# a palloc'd span reads adjacent heap and returns quietly without a sanitizer, so
# the suite would report PASS on the broken code. The sanitizer run is the
# behavioural proof and it belongs to the nightly ASAN job; what this suite can
# assert deterministically is the property that was wrong -- the order.
#
# Line numbers are read from the source rather than counted, because a count
# would pass on a file where the two statements had swapped.

# awk reads the file directly: piping a captured string into a reader that exits

# $2 is an OPTIONAL anchor: the search starts only after a line matching it.
# THE FUNCTION HAS TWO GUARDS WITH THE SAME TEXT. The range-building loop defers
# a chunk the checked decode path would refuse, and the distribution loop bounds
# the validity copy; both read `pageLength < (uint64) validityBytes`. Without an
# anchor this finds the FIRST, which is in the wrong loop -- the ordering check
# would then still pass with the distribution guard deleted, which is the guard
# it exists to pin. Anchoring on the containment test, which only the
# distribution loop has, pins the right one. Reported by @jdatcmd.

# BRACKETS, NOT BACKSLASHES, and this is not style. `awk -v` processes escape

# strips it with a warning and the pattern becomes a regex GROUP that never
# matches the literal text. `memcpy\(entry->vbits` is worse under gawk -- it
# becomes an unmatched `(` and awk exits fatally. Either way both variables come
# back empty and both checks below report "no", so the arm fails on a tree where

# processing and means a literal paren in both. Verified identical under mawk
