# Documentation style gate: the measurable plain-language rules (issue #291).
#
# The project writes its user-facing documentation to ISO 24495-1:2023, Plain
# language - Part 1: Governing principles and guidelines. A rule that nothing
# checks is a rule the next writer does not know about, and this project has been
# bitten by that shape before: an empty REGRESS made `make installcheck` report
# success while running nothing. So the rules that a machine can check are
# checked here, and a document that drifts goes red.
#
# WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. ISO 24495-1 gives four governing principles -- relevant,
# findable, understandable, usable -- and only the third has any mechanically
# checkable content, and only in part. Its own test for "usable" is that a reader
# acts on the document successfully, which no checker performs. So a green run
# means the measurable subset holds, NOT that the documentation is plain. Saying
# so is the point: an unverifiable claim of conformity would be worse than an
# honest partial one.
#
# Two of the four checks are this project's typographic house rules rather than
# anything the standard requires: no em or en dash, and no double hyphen as a
# dash in prose. They are named as house rules wherever they appear so nobody
# mistakes a preference for a requirement.
#
# SCOPE, which is a decision rather than an oversight:
#
#   docs/*.md and README.md are user-facing prose and are checked in full.
#
#   CHANGELOG.md is a record of what happened, written at the time it happened.
#   Rewriting landed entries would edit history, so it is checked for dash
#   characters only.
#
#   design/ holds internal engineering records and is not checked. Code comments
#   are not checked either. Both explain WHY, and the reasoning in them is worth
#   more than the uniformity would be.
#
#   RELEASE_NOTES_*.md, ANNOUNCEMENT_*.md, CONTEXT.md and PROVENANCE.md are NOT
#   checked, and that was asked and answered on 2026-08-29 rather than assumed.
#   Running the checker over them by hand finds 19, 6, 23 and 87 over-long
#   sentences, so the exclusion is not a claim that they conform. A release note
#   and an announcement describe one shipped version and are not revised after
#   it; CONTEXT.md is written for agents working in this repository; and
#   PROVENANCE.md is a clean-room record whose precision outranks its sentence
#   length. The owner's decision was that these four stay outside the gate.
#
#   README.md's version marker is compared against VERSION by the check at the
#   bottom of this file. It was NOT, until 2026-08-29, and it had drifted two
#   versions as a result: it said 1.0-alpha while VERSION said 1.0-alpha3. The
#   only file that was wrong was the one file the comparison could not see.
#
# Usage:  test/docs_style.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# The argument is accepted and ignored; this suite needs no cluster.
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# point lookups. The warning has to sit in the block that gives that advice, not
# in a reference table three pages away -- so these arms are scoped to the block
# and not to the page. An earlier version grepped whole pages and passed on main,

# makes the prose state the floor in a sentence, which is what a warning needs.
#

#
#     README.md             v1.0-alpha2    while v1.0-alpha3 was tagged
#     docs/roadmap.md       v1.0-alpha2

#     CHANGELOG.md          v1.0-alpha3    the only one right
#
# `docs/installation.md` is the one that shows why the scope mattered. It never
# writes the phrase "recorded in `VERSION`", so it was outside the other check
# entirely, and it also carried a stale heading and a stale upgrade chain.
#
# THIS IS AN AGREEMENT CHECK, NOT A COMPARISON, and that is a real limit. No
# tracked file holds "the newest tag" the way VERSION holds the version, and
# reading `git tag` fails in a tree copied without `.git`, which this harness is
# run from. So it catches one document drifting away from the others, which is

# ---- and the UPGRADE CHAIN, which is a fourth place a version is written ----
#
# Two documents tell a reader which installed versions one `ALTER EXTENSION
# pgcolumnar UPDATE` can start from, and which version it arrives at. Both facts
# are knowable from the tree: the shipped `pgcolumnar--A--B.sql` files give the
# set of starting versions, and `pgcolumnar.control` gives the arrival.
#
# Neither was compared against anything. Opening the `1.0-alpha5` cycle bumped
# VERSION, the control file, the badge and META.json, and every check above went
# green, while CHANGELOG.md kept saying that the chain starts at four versions
# and arrives at `1.0-alpha4`. Five ship and it arrives at `1.0-alpha5`.
#
# THE TWO ERRORS CANCEL IF YOU COUNT, which is why this reads the two claims
# separately. CHANGELOG.md named `1.0-alpha4` once too few as a source and once
# too many as the destination, so the set of versions in the sentence was exactly
# right. A rule comparing that set against the tree would have passed on a
# sentence in which both halves were wrong.
#
# SCOPED TO THE SENTENCE, not the paragraph. The surrounding paragraph in
# docs/installation.md also names the destination twice in prose that is correct,
# so a paragraph-wide reading counts the destination as a starting version.
#
# AND THE CLAIM IS REACHABILITY, NOT MEMBERSHIP. "a SINGLE update reaches X from
# ANY of them" says the scripts form an unbroken chain, and reading only the `A`
# side of each filename cannot see that. Reported by @OffgridwithJD, who broke the
# chain without editing a document:
#
#     pgcolumnar--1.0-alpha2--1.0-alpha3.sql -> pgcolumnar--1.0-alpha2--1.0-alphaX.sql
#
# `1.0-alpha2` still starts a script, so the set of starting versions does not
# move and all four arms passed, on a tree where three of the five named versions
# cannot reach `default_version` in one command. So the population below is
# WALKED: from each starting version, follow `A--B` to the script starting at `B`,
# and keep it only if the walk ends at `default_version`. That subsumes the
# membership test, because a version whose target starts nothing drops out.

# grow, so the counts drift with them: CHANGELOG.md read 66 lost at 5649eba, 69 at
# 197602f and 71 here, with nothing about the rule changing. A frozen number in a

# and names the base install script by filename, and no suite, no Makefile rule
# and no CI step ever read it. It went stale for the whole alpha4 cycle:
#
#     version                    1.0.0-alpha.3     while VERSION said 1.0-alpha4
#     provides.pgcolumnar.file   pgcolumnar--1.0-alpha3.sql
#
# THE FILENAME IS THE PART THAT MATTERS. `pgcolumnar--1.0-alpha3.sql` does not
# exist: it was RENAMED to the alpha4 name when the cycle opened, which is how
# this repository makes each cycle's base script. So the published metadata named
# a file the distribution does not contain, and the version strings were only the
# visible half.
#
# The two version forms differ by convention and that is not a bug: PGXN requires
# three-part semver, so `1.0-alpha4` is published as `1.0.0-alpha.4`. The mapping
# is derived here rather than hardcoded, so a future `1.0-beta1` is covered too.

# Every PR that adds an entry inserts as the first child of one heading, so any
# two conflict for a reason unrelated to either change. Nine of 27 merges in one
# day touched this file, and three merge commits that day exist only to resolve
# it. `.gitattributes` now gives CHANGELOG.md a UNION merge driver, which takes
# both sides with no marker.
#
# MEASURED ON THE REAL PAIR, #1098 and #1106, both of which add a new
# `## [Unreleased]` section:
#
#     default 3-way   rc=1, 2 conflict markers
#     merge=union     rc=0, 0 markers, ONE `## [Unreleased]`, both entries intact
#
# The section headers are not doubled because union emits identical lines once:
# 7640 + 57 + 52 = 7749 against an actual 7744, and the 5 are the shared
# `## [Unreleased]` / blank / `### Fixed` / blank prefix.
#
# UNION'S HAZARD IS REAL AND THIS FILE MEETS IT AT EVERY RELEASE. Union keeps
# both sides of a divergent hunk silently, so where one branch EDITS a line that
# another appends beneath, the append survives under the edit. A release cut
# edits exactly that line -- `## [Unreleased]` becomes `## [1.0-alphaN] - date`.
# Reproduced: a PR appending an entry, merged into a release cut, lands that
# entry INSIDE the section that just shipped, with rc=0 and no marker. Today the
# same case conflicts and a human sees it.
#
# So the driver ships with the check below, which is what makes it safe: an entry
# cannot appear in a released section after that release's tag without this
# saying so.
