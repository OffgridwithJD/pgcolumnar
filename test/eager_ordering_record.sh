# pgColumnar eager rewrites record the ordering they applied (#758).
#
# pgcolumnar.storage.sorted_by and sorted_kind exist (#415) to say WHAT ordering
# the last rewrite left behind, so that a later reader can tell a lexicographic
# run from a Z-order run without guessing. Only the online recluster wrote them;
# both eager rewrites reached the catalog through record_sorted_extent(), which
# passed NIL and NULL, so an eagerly sorted table and an eagerly Z-ordered table
# were indistinguishable in the catalog.
#
# They are not the same layout. Z-order over two or more columns is not a sort
# on any one of them, and sort_status falls back to the DECLARED options.sort_by
# when storage.sorted_by is NULL -- so a Z-ordered table reported "fully sorted,
# no tail, on key {k}" while its physical order held hundreds of inversions on
# k. Anything reading that to decide an ordering (#751 pathkeys) would be
# silently wrong on LIMIT and on merge joins.
#
# THE FIXTURE MUST USE A TWO-COLUMN KEY. Single-column Z-order IS lexicographic
# order, so a one-column fixture cannot tell the two apart and every arm below
# would pass by construction. The inversion counts asserted as premises are what
# keeps that honest: they fail if the fixture ever stops discriminating.

# corroborate with the LAYOUT: the exact set of (group_number, file_offset)
# rows in pgcolumnar.row_group. A gate that fired rewrote nothing and that set
# is byte-identical; a fall-through retires every group and writes new ones, so
