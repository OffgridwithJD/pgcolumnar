# The skip loop must resolve pgcolumnar.zone_map ONCE per scan, not once per
# chunk group per predicate column (#744).
#
# What it cost. pgcolumnar_native_group_can_match calls
# PgColumnarReadZoneMapForColumn for every group a predicate could exclude, and
# that call used to run open_columnar_table (pgcolumnar_schema_oid,
# get_relname_relid, table_open with a lock and a resource-owner remember) plus
# pgcolumnar_index_oid (a second get_relname_relid), then close again. The
# md_flush reuse cache could not help: it is gated on md_flush.active, which only
# columnar_write_state.c ever sets, so the read path never reached it.
#
# Measured at 640 chunk groups, one predicate column, the same binary with the
# session bypassed (sess = NULL, which is byte-for-byte the old open-and-close
# path), backend instructions pinned to one PMU and normalised by the number of
# queries that completed in the window:
#
#     baseline  29,699,977 / 29,688,941   ->  29,694,459 per query
#     session   26,674,578 / 26,678,602   ->  26,676,590
#     saved     3,017,869  =  4,715 per chunk group,  1.113x
#
# Within-arm spread is 0.04% and 0.02% against a 10.2% effect. That is 15% of
# the locate cost #744 priced at this size, so the systable index probe, which
# stays inside the loop, is the larger part and #403 item 2 is not diminished
# by this change.
#
# An earlier version of this comment claimed 1.304x and 87%. Both were wrong,
# and the cause is worth keeping: the baseline arm defeated the cache with
# `if (1)` while leaving `sess` non-NULL, so every probe opened a relation and
# NONE of them closed, because the close is gated on `sess == NULL`. That arm
# leaked a reference per group and did strictly more work than the code it was
# standing in for. The tell was arithmetic: the "saving" exceeded the entire
# cost of the component being optimised. Bypass with sess = NULL, which is the
# real path, not a mutation of it.
#
# Buffers did NOT move on either arm: a catcache or relcache lookup reads no
# buffers once warm, so the buffer cost of a probe is the index scan alone.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE ASSERTS is the work done, not the answer. A scan returns the
# same rows either way, so a correctness test cannot see this land or regress.
# The runner's DEBUG1 witness reports probes and real opens, and the pair is the
# assertion: probes scales with the group count, opens must stay at one.
#
# The lifetime arms are here because the first implementation of this was WRONG
# in a way no correctness test caught. It held the relation in a static shared
# across scans, and a scan that ereports never runs its end hook, so after a
# subtransaction rollback the next scan reused a Relation the subtransaction's
# resource owner had already released. Every functional check still passed: a
# released relcache entry is refcount-decremented rather than freed, so the
# stale pointer read correctly. It showed up only as a missing witness. The
# session now lives in the scan's own read state, so nothing crosses scans.
#
# Usage:  test/native_zonemap_session.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
