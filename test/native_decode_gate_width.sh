# pgColumnar: gate phase-2 decode gating on PAYLOAD WIDTH (#595).
#
# #452 phase 2 evaluates an unprunable qual (a leading-wildcard LIKE) per
# 1024-row vector between the two decode passes, so a vector no row can pass
# skips its PAYLOAD columns' decode. That per-vector evaluation costs the same
# whatever the projection, but its only payoff is the payload it spares -- the
# projected columns that are NOT the qual's own. On a WIDE SELECT * there is a
# lot to spare and gating wins (ClickBench q24: 6098->3395 ms). On a NARROW
# aggregate (a count, a one-column sum) there is almost nothing to spare and the
# evaluation is pure cost -- eight ClickBench queries regressed 1.2-2x.
#
# So #595 gates the gate on width: it runs only when the number of projected
# non-qual columns is at least pgcolumnar.qual_skipvec_min_payload_cols (default
# 20). This suite pins that policy -- NOT the machinery, which
# native_decode_gating.sh covers -- so its observable is not "does the mask drop
# the right rows" but "did the per-vector gating RUN AT ALL for this projection".
#
# The observable is the machinery suite's own primary one: "Columnar Vector
# Decodes", which counts (vector, column) decodes.
#   - gating RAN     -> the payload columns are NOT decoded on skipped vectors,
#                       so the count drops toward the qual column alone;
#   - gating did NOT -> every projected column is decoded for every vector, so
#                       the count is exactly VECTORS * (projected columns).
# The difference between those two numbers is the whole signal, and both are
# present and countable in the plan (the machinery suite pins the counter's unit),
# so a "did not gate" arm reads a real number rather than an absent line.
#
# The threshold is exercised by MOVING it across a fixed projection width rather
# than by changing the table: the same wide SELECT * gates at the default and
# stops gating once the GUC is raised above its width, and the same narrow
# projection does not gate at the default but does once the GUC is set to 0.
# The GUC is set per DATABASE (ALTER DATABASE ... SET) because every psql helper
# opens a fresh connection; a session SET would not survive to the next query.
#
# Usage:  test/native_decode_gate_width.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar; it reuses no upstream test file.
