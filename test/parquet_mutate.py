# Deterministic byte-level mutator for the Parquet decode fuzzer (issue #214).
#
# Every mutant is a pure function of (seed file, seed integer), so a crash
# reproduces exactly from the two values printed with it. Nothing here is
# random at run time.
#
# The mutation set is chosen for what a hand-written Thrift and Parquet reader
# gets wrong, not for uniform coverage of the byte space. A flat bit-flipper
# spends nearly all of its budget inside page payloads, where the worst outcome
# is a wrong value; the interesting failures are in the footer, the schema
# chain, and any field the reader trusts as a length, a count, or an offset.
#
# Usage:  python3 test/parquet_mutate.py SEEDFILE SEED OUTFILE
