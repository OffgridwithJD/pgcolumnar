# The columnar scan must be priced for what the zone maps let it skip (#434).
#
# The scan skips a row group whose stored minimum and maximum prove the
# restriction cannot match, but the cost model quoted a full scan regardless. An
# index scan on the same relation was quoted at its best case, so the planner
# preferred it: priced 12,407 and ran 500 ms, against a columnar scan priced
# 17,326 that ran 43 ms. Declined a plan 11.6x faster, on a correlated bigint key
# with 80 percent of the rows excluded.
#
# What is asserted here is the PLAN and the COST RELATION, not wall clock. Which
# plan the planner picks is deterministic given statistics, so nothing in this
# suite is timing-sensitive.
#
# The control is the point. A blanket discount would also flip the correlated
# case, and would be wrong: pruning depends on how the matching rows are LAID
# OUT, not on how many there are. So the same query shape runs against a
# scattered key, where every group holds the full value range and nothing can be
# skipped, and the discount must NOT appear there.
#

# Two tables, one query shape. `seq` ascends with physical order; `scat` is the
# same values in an order uncorrelated with it, so its zone maps overlap and
# prune nothing.
# `saw` is the third shape, and it is the one correlation cannot see (#461).
#
# Correlation measures agreement between value order and physical order across
# the WHOLE relation. Pruning is local: a group is skipped when its own min and
# max rule the predicate out. A table can be globally unsorted and locally tight
# at once, and that is not a corner case -- it is what batch-loaded time-series
# data looks like, which is the shape this engine exists for.
#
# So each group of 10,000 rows covers one narrow band of the value range, and the
# bands are handed out by (i * 9) mod 20, which is a permutation because 9 and 20
# are coprime. Group spans come out 0-9999, 90000-99999, 180000-189999 and so on:
# 5 percent of the range each, in an order that does not follow physical order.
#
# The multiplier is chosen, not decorative. Correlation of (i * m) mod 20 with i:
#
#     m = 7  ->  +0.3665      m = 9  ->  +0.0376      m = 19 ->  -0.7143
#
# m = 7 was the first version and it is the trap this issue is about: 0.3665
# earns a partial rho^2 discount, so the check below would have PASSED without
# any fix, for the wrong reason, on the exact defect under test. m = 9 lands at
# 0.0376, next to the 0.0133 and 0.0463 measured on the TSBS `time` column in
# #391 -- the case on the record.
#
# The within-group order is scrambled too ((g * 7919) mod 10000). Letting values
# ascend inside a group adds correlation on top of the band ordering, and local
# tightness only needs min and max to be narrow, never sorted.
