# A scan must not answer a backward fetch with forward rows.
#
# pgcolumnar_scan_getnextslot takes a ScanDirection and never read it: every
# call advanced forward. heap_getnextslot passes direction through to
# heapgettup, which walks the other way. So a scrollable cursor over a columnar
# relation, on a plan that reaches the table AM rather than the custom scan,
# silently returned the wrong rows:
#
#     FETCH FORWARD 5   then   FETCH BACKWARD 3
#     heap:     1 2 3 4 5  then  4 3 2
#     columnar: 1 2 3 4 5  then  6 7 8
#
# and FETCH LAST returned nothing at all where the heap returned row 20.
#
# A true backward scan over native storage is a feature, not a bug fix: the
# reader walks row groups and decodes vectors forwards. What this pins is that
# the AM never INVENTS an answer. Forward is unchanged, no-movement fetches
# nothing, and a backward fetch raises 0A000 rather than returning rows that were
# never asked for.
#
# The arms assert SQLSTATE rather than message text. A grep for "not supported"
# is also satisfied by a dozen unrelated errors, and by a connection failure.
#
# Usage:  test/scan_direction.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
