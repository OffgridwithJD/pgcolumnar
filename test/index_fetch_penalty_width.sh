# pgColumnar: the index-fetch penalty charges decode CPU by column WIDTH, not by a
# bare column count (#803).
#
# pgcolumnar_index_fetch_penalty prices the row-group decode a per-row fetch forces.
# Its CPU term was cpu_operator_cost * R * nproj, where nproj is a count of the
# decoded prefix's columns, so a 68-byte text column was charged exactly what a
# 4-byte int4 column was -- the same flatness #768 fixed for the sequential scan.
#
# Measured before the fix, on the two tables this suite builds: the decode CPU term
# was 200.00 on both arms across an 8.6x difference in decoded bytes, while the same
# ~39k-row fetch took 4,385 ms narrow against 88,352 ms wide. The consequence was not
# merely under-pricing but an inverted ordering -- the model let the WIDE table fetch
# about 3x more rows than the narrow one before switching to a scan, when in reality
# the wide table can afford about 3x FEWER. At 120 rows the wide table's chosen index
# plan measured 239.6 ms against an 82.9 ms scan.
#
# This suite pins the ordering, which is the part that changes a plan, and does it
# from the PLAN rather than the clock so it is not a timing check and PGC_SKIP_TIMING
# never applies to it. The absolute row counts are deliberately not asserted: they
# move with the cost constants, and the defect is the direction.
#
# nproj is the decoded PREFIX length (pgcolumnar_scan_decode_shape sets *nprefix =
# maxatt, per #363), so width cannot be varied at a fixed prefix inside one table.
# Hence two tables of identical shape whose columns differ only in TYPE at each
# position: the prefix is four columns on both arms by construction.
#
# Both prefixes are kept far below COLUMNAR_FETCH_CACHE_MAX_BYTES so the width-aware
# cache-overflow blend is inactive on both arms and cannot be what the check measures;
# that is asserted, not assumed. That the penalty must still not over-fire on a
# clustered index or a point lookup is pinned by test/analyze_stats.sh (#355, #376).
#
# Usage:  test/index_fetch_penalty_width.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
