# pgColumnar Parquet decode fuzzer (issue #214).
#
# test/fuzz.sh is a differential suite over data SHAPES with heap as the oracle:
# it never presents a malformed byte to a decoder. This one is the other half.
# It mutates valid Parquet files and feeds them to every entry point that parses
# one, and asserts a single property:
#
#     a malformed file makes the backend raise an ERROR, never die.
#
# That is the property #210 broke. A crafted footer reached unbounded recursion
# in PgColumnarThriftSkip, and a crafted schema chain reached a second one in
# walk_schema, either of which takes down the whole cluster rather than the
# session. Both were found by reading code. This suite is the machine that was
# missing.
#
# Anything that is not a clean ERROR is a finding, and there are three kinds:
#   crash   the backend died (signal, or the connection dropped)
#   san     a sanitizer reported (only on a sanitizer build)
#   hang    the statement outlived its timeout
# A hang is a finding in its own right and not a nuisance: an unkillable decode
# loop is #212's shape, and the only way out of one today is kill -9.
#
# Every mutant is a pure function of (seed file, seed integer), so a finding
# reproduces exactly. Findings are saved with the two values that regenerate
# them, and the file itself is kept because a minimized repro is worth more than
# a description of one.
#
# Usage:  test/fuzz_parquet.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#   PGC_SEED=<int>            base seed (default 20260728)
#   PGC_ITERS=<int>           mutants to run (default 100)
#   PGC_FUZZ_KEEP=1           keep every mutant, not only the findings
#   PGC_FUZZ_FINDINGS=<dir>   save findings outside the workdir, for campaigns
#
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
