# pgColumnar Parquet recursion-depth hardening suite.
#
# The footer parser has two recursions whose depth is taken directly from the
# file, so a crafted footer can drive the C stack into its guard page and
# SIGSEGV the backend. A backend segfault is a crash: the postmaster terminates
# every other session and reinitializes the cluster, so this is a whole-cluster
# denial of service from one input file, not a single-statement error.
#
# The two recursions are independent and each needs its own guard -- one does not
# cover the other, because they are reached at different points:
#
#   1. PgColumnarThriftSkip recurses through nested structs (and lists of structs).
#      Every unrecognised metadata field is skipped through it, so it is reached
#      straight from the footer bytes, before any schema is interpreted. A footer
#      that is just N struct openers nests N deep.
#
#   2. walk_schema recurses through the schema tree, once per nesting level, with
#      num_children read straight from the footer. This runs only AFTER the footer
#      parses, so a footer that never trips (1) reaches it. A schema that chains a
#      group inside a group inside a group descends here as deep as the file says.
#
# Both are guarded with check_stack_depth(), which turns the crash into a caught
# ERROR (SQLSTATE 54001, statement_too_complex). That each guard is load-bearing
# for its own vector was proven by removal at the depths that actually overflow an
# 8 MB stack: with only the PgColumnarThriftSkip guard present a schema chain still
# SIGSEGVs, and with only the walk_schema guard present a nested-struct footer
# still SIGSEGVs.
#
# This suite is the regression for that, and deliberately does NOT overflow the
# real C stack: it pins max_stack_depth to its minimum so a ~20 KB fixture trips
# the guard on any build in the matrix. At that fixture depth, removing a guard
# makes its check fail by returning the wrong answer (NOERR, or a parse error)
# rather than by crashing. That is the intended trade: a harness that proved
# itself by segfaulting a backend could not be run in the matrix at all.
#
# Run on an assert-enabled build, so if a guard is ever removed the crash it lets
# through is unmistakable.
#
# Usage:  test/native_parquet_stack.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
