# pgColumnar: a covering projection scan must be able to run in parallel.
#
# PgColumnarSetRelPathlist offers a covering projection as a serial CustomPath
# (parallel_aware = false, parallel_safe = false) and a parallel base scan as a
# partial path with no projection name. Those cannot both be true of one plan:
# either Gather wins and the projection is dropped, or the serial projection
# wins and the workers are dropped. A covering query under parallel settings
# should be both.
#
# Gather in the plan is not enough. A partial path that no worker claims a
# stripe from still looks parallel, and the leader (or a single claimer)
# still returns the covering rows once. The load-bearing arms are EXPLAIN
# ANALYZE: two workers launched, and both produced rows. Same public seam
# parallel_am_scan already uses for the table-AM claimer.
#
# Independent of test/pytest/test_projection_parallel.py. Same public seam
# (EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE of a covering projection query, plus the
# query's count). Own table, own row count, own bounds. Neither file is
# read by the other.
#
# Usage:  test/projection_parallel.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# ---- an I/O-dominated covering scan is not quoted at 1/N of its cost (#1209) -
#
# Raising seq_page_cost until the base relation's I/O dominates its decode CPU
# must cost the PARALLEL covering path, because core leaves disk I/O whole and
# amortises only CPU. If the partial covering total divided both, an I/O-bound
# scan would be quoted at 1/N and Gather would keep winning however expensive
# the pages became.
#
# THIS IS NOT A GUARD ON THE CLAMP, and the difference is measured rather than
# assumed. Removing `if (ioRunProj > projRun) ioRunProj = projRun;` entirely
# changes NOTHING here: every rung of the ladder below reads the same, and the
# suite passes. The arithmetic says why. At the binding point, with pre =
# ioRun*projScale > projRun:
#
#     clamped     total = startup + projRun
#     unclamped   total = startup + pre + (projRun - pre)/divisor
#
# and the difference has a sign: unclamped - clamped = (pre - projRun) *
# (1 - 1/divisor), which is strictly positive because pre > projRun IS the
# binding condition and divisor > 1 always. Removing the clamp makes the partial
# path DEARER, so the serial covering path wins either way and no plan moves. The clamp earns its
# place by keeping cpuRunProj from going negative, which is an internal quantity
# no plan exposes -- not by changing a decision.
#
# What DOES redden the second arm is amortising the I/O: rewriting the total as
# `(ioRunProj + cpuRunProj) / divisor` gives `got [gather+projection] want
# [projection-only]` at the top of the ladder.
#
# #1209 for the measurement behind this: the clamp IS reachable, at
# seq_page_cost > C/(A-B) = 2625 on a 20,000-row fixture, predicted from a fit
# of six points and then confirmed at 2048 (no, by 0.9%) and 4096 (yes).

# THE THRESHOLD IS NOT SCALE-INVARIANT, and an earlier draft of this
# comment said it was (@jdatcmd caught it). The claim rested on two fixtures
# that agreed -- and both were 20,000 rows, so their agreement says the
# difference is insensitive to CONTENT and says nothing about N. Measured on
# three fixtures, the rung at seq_page_cost = 4096:
#
#     20,000 rows, range 300     projection-only     threshold 2625
#     32,000 rows, range 8,000   gather+projection   threshold above 4096
#     50,000 rows, range 12,100  gather+projection   threshold above 4096
#
# It GROWS with the row count. C = cpuRun * projScale scales with N while
# basePagesRead - projPages came out at 2 pages regardless, so the quotient
# rises: 2625 * 32/20 = 4200 and 2625 * 50/20 = 6560, both above 4096, which
# is what the two rungs show.
#
# So THE ARM IS SAFE BY MARGIN, NOT BY INVARIANCE. 1000000 is roughly 150x
# the largest threshold observed. Pinning a rung near a crossover would rest
# on whatever ANALYZE sampled that day; this does not.
#
# THE TWO ARMS ARE A PAIR AND NEITHER HALF IS SOUND ALONE (@jdatcmd, review).
# The second cannot separate "I/O is left whole" from "there is no parallel
# covering path at all": both read projection-only. The premise at
# seq_page_cost=1 is what excludes the second reading, so deleting it as
# redundant leaves a passing arm that proves nothing.
#
# The ladder is printed rather than summarised: a failure of the second arm has
# two possible causes -- the partial total amortising I/O, or a host where the
# covering projection is not smaller than the base's read columns so no page
# cost ever tips it -- and the rungs tell them apart.
