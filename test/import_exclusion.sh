# pgColumnar import against an exclusion constraint (follow-up to #153).
#
# #158 made import_arrow and import_parquet maintain indexes, which fixed index
# scans returning nothing and unique constraints accepting duplicates. It did not
# cover exclusion constraints, and they are not unique indexes: index_insert does
# not enforce one. The executor inserts the entry and then scans for a conflicting
# one, through check_exclusion_constraint. Without that call an import could leave
# a table in a state an ordinary INSERT would have refused -- entries present, the
# constraint violated, nothing raised.
#
# That is the same shape as #153 itself, which is why it belongs with it rather
# than in a general-purpose suite.
#
# The interesting risk in the fix is the opposite one: a check that fires when it
# should not would break every import into a table that merely has an exclusion
# constraint, which is why the first thing asserted is that a clean import still
# works.
#
# Usage:  test/import_exclusion.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
