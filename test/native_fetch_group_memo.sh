# The by-row-number fetch resolves its row group from a memo, not a per-fetch
# catalog scan (#709).
#
# pgcolumnar_fetch_row runs once per fetched TID -- twice, in fact: a liveness
# settle and a deferred decode (#157) -- and each call read the ENTIRE row-group
# list out of the catalog (an index scan of pgcolumnar.row_group per call).
# K fetched rows cost ~2K catalog index scans; measured 6001 scans for 3000
# rows on the unfixed build. The memo keeps the list per (storage, command,
# snapshot content) and refreshes on a miss, which is what preserves the old
# per-fetch read's contract that a group flushed earlier in the same statement
# is visible.
#
# The instrument counts work done, not intent: pg_stat_get_xact_numscans on
# row_group_pkey, read as a BASELINE/AFTER DELTA inside the one session that
# runs the measured statement (the counter is a pending-stats entry; a fresh
# connection reads 0). The row_group TABLE's scan delta must stay 0 in the
# same window, or a broken index resolution would fake the bound green by
# degrading to heap scans. The plan shape is pinned from the same session,
# BEFORE the baseline, because planning itself reads the list once
# (relation_estimate_size).
#
# The savepoint arm is the removal proof for the subxact-abort reset: a
# group flushed under a savepoint must vanish from the memo at ROLLBACK TO
# SAVEPOINT, where nothing else changes -- not the cid, not the snapshot
# content. The same-statement rewrite arm is the removal proof for the
# retirement reset, and it fires on PG18: PG17's rewrite path happens to
# cross a CommandCounterIncrement that rebuilds the memo anyway, PG18's does
# not, and the matrix runs both. Poisoning manifests as all-NULL rows -- the
# group comes from the memo while the fresh column_chunk read finds
# nothing -- so both arms count ROWS, never values.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fetch_group_memo.sh [PG_CONFIG]
