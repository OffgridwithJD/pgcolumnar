# Fetching from a row group larger than the fetch-cache cap (#433).
#
# The fetch cache keyed on (storageId, groupNumber) works, and below the cap a
# second fetch into the same group is nearly free. Above it the hit rate was zero
# BY CONSTRUCTION: the entry was populated, used once, and dropped whole, because
# the group's raw bytes alone exceeded the cap and groupBuffer could not be
# released while any baseline column pointed into it. Every fetched row therefore
# re-read and re-decoded the whole group. Measured on a 60,909,712-byte group in
# perfect key order: +7,476 shared buffers per row.
#
# test/native_fetch_cache.sh could not see this. Its widest fixture is
# repeat('a',150) text, which compresses far below the cap, so the whole-entry
# branch never executed anywhere in the suite. That is why this survived #143,
# #157 and #359, each of which moved the cliff rather than removing it.
#
# The measurement here is BUFFERS, not wall clock. The defect is "the group is
# re-read once per row", which is a count, and a count does not need a quiet
# machine to be true. Nothing in this suite is timing-sensitive, so none of it is
# subject to PGC_SKIP_TIMING.

# Usage:  test/native_fetch_bigcap.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# path is forced, and every measured query asserts it got one. Whether the
# planner should choose it is #434, and that is a separate suite.

# The fixture, whose premise is its ON-DISK SIZE.
#
# #433 records two earlier attempts at this fixture that silently compressed 17x
# and 25x and would have been green while measuring nothing: repeat(md5(...), 32)
# repeats ONE string, and an uncorrelated scalar subquery is evaluated once for
# all rows. Both produce a table that never crosses the cap.
#
# So the payload is per-row distinct hex, built from a subquery correlated on g,
# and the block codec is off so the stored size is the encoded size and not a
# codec's opinion of it. Neither of those is trusted: the size is read back from
# pgcolumnar.row_group and asserted before any measurement is taken.
