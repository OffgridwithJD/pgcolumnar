# pgColumnar: the per-table encode_effort option (#155).
#
# encode_effort = fast skips the FSST substring search -- the symbol-table
# build, the whole-corpus "does it help" decision, and the per-vector encode.
# That is where a text column's write cost lives: measured on 1,000,000 rows,
# one text column, loads run 1.2x to 5.7x faster without it.
#
# THE CHECKS DO NOT TIME ANYTHING. A wall-clock assertion on an encoder is the
# kind that fails on a busy box and gets believed anyway; this suite discriminates
# on stored bytes, which is deterministic. Skipping FSST is observable because
# the bytes change, and it changes them in a known direction: FSST is only ever
# chosen when it makes a vector smaller, so "fast" is never smaller than "full".
#
# THE SHAPE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THIS FILE. On most text, FSST is computed and
# then loses, so full and fast store byte-for-byte identical data and any check
# comparing them passes without testing anything. Of seven shapes measured, five
# were identical. This file uses md5(g) -- 32 hex chars, high cardinality,
# shared alphabet -- because it is one of the two where FSST actually wins, and
# so one of the two where the option is observable at all.
#
# Usage:  test/encode_effort.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# Hold fsst_min_gain_percent at 0 for the whole suite, deliberately.
#
# This file compares encode_effort=fast against full, and that comparison only
# says anything on a shape where FSST is actually chosen. md5 text is such a
# shape, but only marginally: FSST wins it by roughly 2 percent, which is exactly
# the sub-margin win the shipped default of 5 declines (#155, #271). At the
# default, FSST is dropped for both arms, they store identical bytes, and the
# suite fails reporting equal sizes. It did, on all five majors, the first time
# that default landed.
#
# Pinning it states the dependency rather than inheriting it: the option under
# test here is encode_effort, so the margin is held where FSST stays in play
# instead of being left to a default that is free to move. The margin's own
# behaviour is covered by fsst_margin.sh.
#
# Set on the database rather than per statement because psql_run opens its own
# connection per call, so a SET would not outlive one, and every load in this
# file needs it, not only the first pair.
