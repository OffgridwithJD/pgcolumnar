# ---- a check that could not run is a third state, not a pass ----------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every check in this harness has two outcomes: it printed PASS
# or it printed FAIL. When a check's INPUT is absent -- a fixture that did not
# build, a capability the server lacks, a file the probe reads that is not there
# -- the check either passes vacuously or fails for a reason that has nothing to
# do with the property under test. Neither answer is true. The suite says
# "checks run: N" either way, and a reader counting greens counts one that never
# asked its question.
#
# That is the same defect as a permanent SKIP one level down: a skip you wrote is
# a check you did not write. `pgc_skip` already refuses to let a MISSING
# DEPENDENCY read as a pass -- it FAILS unless waived deliberately. This gives a
# single CHECK the same honesty at check granularity.
#
# THE STATE MUST NOT BE A PASS AT THE SUITE LEVEL EITHER, which is the whole
# point: a suite holding an unrunnable check exits PGC_EXIT_INCOMPLETE, not 0, so
# a runner cannot report it green. Failure still dominates -- a suite with both a
# FAIL and an UNRUN is FAILED, because the failure is the more urgent fact.
#
# WHY A NEW EXIT CODE AND NOT 66. 66 means "ran no checks". A suite with one
# unrunnable check DID run checks, and collapsing the two states would lose the
# distinction between "this suite is inert" and "this suite could not evaluate
# one thing". 67 is chosen on the same grounds 66 was: bash produces 1, 2, 126,
# 127 and 128+n; psql produces 1, 2, 3; make produces 1 and 2. And as with 66,
# the code alone is not trusted -- the runner must also see the INCOMPLETE line
# in the log, because `set -e` can propagate any status an aborting command
# returns.

# (column_projection, int8_agg_int128, native_fetch_bigcap, native_fetch_cache,
# objstore_http_read, planner_choice_quality -- twelve call sites, none in a
# subshell). The line meant to prove the states reconcile could not see it.
