# ---- an arm's failure must say what it measured (#1164) ---------------------
#
#     check "..." "$([ "$WF" -le $((NF * 2)) ] && echo yes || echo no)" "yes"
#
# Two measured numbers, reduced to `yes`/`no` before the comparison. The failure
# reads `got no want yes`, which is the word FAILED spelled twice. A reader who
# hits that red at 3am learns nothing about WF, NF, or how far apart they were.
#
# WHAT IT COST, measured rather than imagined. A PG 15 leg reddened one arm of
# `sorted_pathkeys`, and two sessions spent an afternoon unable to say whether the
# ORACLE (a six-buffer spurious gap) or the CONTROL (a fourteen-buffer collapse)
# had failed -- different defects with different owners. Four further experiments
# were aimed at a target whose identity was unknown.
#
# AND THE SHELL SIDE IS WHERE THE LESSON LANDS HARDEST, because the shell suite
# for that very property had ALWAYS carried its numbers --
#
#     no (on=$PB_NOORDER_ON off=$PB_NOORDER_OFF over $PB_GROUPS groups)
#
# -- and the pytest PORT dropped them. Two of the four pairs repaired under #1164
# were port regressions of exactly that shape. `compare_to_bash` grades the check
# NAME, so both halves graded `missing: 0` while one printed its measurement and
# the other printed `got 0 want 1`. Name parity does not preserve diagnostics.
#
# WHY THIS IS A LIST AND NOT A ZERO. The pytest corpus reaches zero and its twin
# asserts zero. This corpus holds 55 such arms across 36 suites, and a rule that
# went red on arrival with 55 offenders would be switched off within a week. So
# the debt is TRACKED, in `test/lossy_arms.tsv`, and the gate refuses BOTH
# directions: an unlisted offender fails by name, and a listed arm that has since
# been repaired fails until its row goes. The list may only shrink, and it does so
# by construction rather than by anyone maintaining a number.
#
# The asymmetry between the two halves is deliberate. The corpora are in different
# states, and a guard that asserted zero over both would claim a property this
# tree does not have.
#
# THE RULE. An `$([ TEST ] && echo A || echo B)` handed to a recorder is refused
# -- and so is `$([ TEST ] && echo A)` with no else, which is WORSE: it reports
# `got [] want [ok]`, losing the measurement and the verdict together.
# when both hold:
#
#   (a) the failing set has MORE THAN ONE MEMBER, so the boolean does not say
#       which state was reached; AND
#   (b) NEITHER echo carries a value, so the message cannot recover it.
#
# Determinate, and deliberately out of scope: unary file and string tests
# (`-f`, `-n`, `-z` and the rest), equality (`=`, `!=`, `-eq`, `-ne`), and
# nothing-versus-something (`-gt 0`, `-ge 1`) where exactly one value fails.
#
# THOSE CARVE-OUTS ARE NOT TIDINESS, THEY WERE MEASURED. Three drafts of this
# sweep over-reported, each caught by reading what it SELECTED rather than by
# trusting the count: `-f "$CB"` flagged as lossy (a file test names its own
# failure), `-n "$emsg"` flagged twice after `n` and `z` were dropped from the
# unary set in a rewrite, and equality flagged before it was excluded. The counts
# went 77, then 94, then 55. **A rule that fails toward MORE findings is the
# direction that gets published**, so the carve-outs are driven below rather than
# described.
#
# SCOPED TO test/*.sh, one glob, non-recursive. `test/selftest/` is NOT swept, and
# that is a decision rather than an accident: this file's own explanation of the
# rule, and the control fixture below, both contain the shape they exist to
# describe. Sweeping the file that enforces a rule for instances of that rule is
# selftest 260's mistake.

# THE CONTROL RUNS FIRST, because a sweep that matches nothing reports the same
# clean result as a corpus with nothing to find -- the `d41d8cd98f00` shape, where
# an extractor that finds nothing hashes identically on both sides. A planted
# fixture says the matcher can still see the thing it is looking for.
