# ---- a registered suite must account for its checks, or say it cannot -------
#
# The matrix prints "suites that ran: N of M" and never checks it. Two different
# things hide behind that line.
#
# The first is arithmetic nobody does. ran + skipped + incomplete is printed
# beside M and never compared with it, so a suite whose verdict the tally loop
# drops leaves the sum short and the line still reads plausibly.
#
# The second is worse, because it is live today. pgc_classify_suite_rc maps rc=0
# to PASS with no further question, and twelve registered suites exit 0 without
# ever calling pgc_summary. Measured, with a pattern tight enough to exclude
# portlib.sh -- a looser one matched it and gave both reviewers of this change the
# same wrong answer: NONE of the twelve sources test/lib.sh. Each defines its own
# check(), and ten of them keep no tally at all. So the harness cannot see their
# checks, and nothing says so. They are counted among the suites that "ran", which
# is the exact overcount #447 added that line to stop, one level further down.
#
# The number is deliberately not repeated in prose elsewhere. The reconciliation
# prints it at runtime, and a count in prose is the thing this repository keeps
# having to unlearn: nine collisions on one written number in a single day.
#
# So the fix is NOT a number. A count cannot do this job: two errors of opposite
# sign cancel, and an exempt list maintained by hand makes the count agree by
# construction -- the check then measures the list, not the run.
#
# Instead, derive MEMBERSHIP from a property each suite carries, and assert set
# equality in BOTH directions:
#
#   declared  the suite's own text calls pgc_summary
#   observed  the suite's log carries the "accounting:" line pgc_summary prints
#             on every exit path, before it decides the status
#
# Neither is a number and neither is hand-maintained. A suite that stops calling
# pgc_summary moves between the sets on its own, and the two directions catch
# opposite mistakes: declared-but-not-observed is a suite that died before it
# could account, and observed-but-not-declared is a stale reading of the source.
#
# The functions are EVALLED OUT OF run_all_versions.sh, per selftest 320: a check
# that restates the rule tests the world instead of the code.

# ---- the POPULATION, which the symmetry check above cannot see --------------
#
# pgc_reconcile_accounting reconciles the DECLARED set against the OBSERVED one.
# Both are derived from the suites themselves, and the two directions catch
# opposite mistakes -- but the registered set is not one of its inputs, so a
# registered suite in NEITHER set is outside the universe being reconciled.
# Driven from the function: with all three files empty it prints
# `inputs=0 | both=0 ... sum=0` and returns 0, whatever SUITES holds.
#
# Reported by @linuxhikerpm, who put it structurally: treating absence of a
# declaration as absence from the population preserves the overcount. The title
# of this change claims to reconcile registered suites against accounted ones,
# and that claim needs the registered set as an input.
#
# So the population is its own check, over its own four buckets. A suite is
# ACCOUNTED when its log carries evidence it counted its checks -- either
# lib.sh's accounting line, or its own `checks run:` line, which is what
# bench_guards and docs_style print from private counters. Runtime-observable in
# both cases, and derived rather than declared, so a suite that adopts either
# mechanism leaves the debt bucket on its own.

# the narrower reader reintroduced a smaller version of the same overcount in the line
# added to close it.

# that prints its own `checks run:` line. Measured on this tree: of the twelve
# registered suites that never call `pgc_summary`, exactly two emit a tally of their own
# -- `bench_guards` and `docs_style` -- and the other ten keep none. The two are the 2.
