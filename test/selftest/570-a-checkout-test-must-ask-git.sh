# ---- deciding "is this a checkout" must ask git, not stat .git (#1224) -------
#
# A linked worktree's `.git` is a regular FILE containing `gitdir: <path>`, not a
# directory. So does a tree staged with the one-line gitfile devloop.sh writes
# into its build dir, and so does an agent's copy staged across a container
# boundary. In all three git answers perfectly and `[ -d "$SRCDIR/.git" ]` is
# false.
#
# extension_upgrade.sh decided that way in two places and skipped its default
# path in every one of those environments -- including "the audit container,
# worktrees of a clone", which selftest 310 names as one of the five
# environments this harness runs in. A supported environment could not run that
# suite.
#
# THE TREE ALREADY HAD THE RIGHT TEST, TWO DIRECTORIES AWAY. devloop.sh uses
# `rev-parse --absolute-git-dir` and says why: "SRC may itself be a linked
# worktree, where .git is a FILE and that path is not a git directory."
# docs_style.sh and native_upgrade_converge.sh use rev-parse too. The defect was
# one file against three, not a missing idiom.
#
# THIS ARM IS A CLASS GUARD, NOT A LIST. It asks whether any suite decides the
# question by stat-ing `.git`, which is derived from the text rather than
# enumerated -- so a fourth file adopting the wrong form is caught without
# anyone maintaining a roster.

# PREMISE FIRST: the sweep must be able to match something. A pattern that
# cannot match reports zero, and zero is exactly the answer this arm wants --
# which is how a guard for wrong patterns ships with a wrong pattern.

# THE PATTERN SHIPPED IN #1224 MISSED THREE OF EIGHT FORMS (#1227), all for one

# by @OffgridwithJD and reproduced here, 5 of 10 caught. It also missed a nested
# path, `"$WORK/$name/.git"`.
#
# A guard that under-reports is worse than none: it answers the question with a
# number that looks like coverage. The pattern now spans from the test operator
# to `.git` and requires a non-word character after it, so `.gitignore`,
# `.gitattributes` and `.github` cannot satisfy it.

# AND IT READS COMMANDS, NOT LINES (@OffgridwithJD, review). bash continues a
# command after a trailing backslash, so
#
#     if [ -d \
#         "$SRCDIR/.git" ]; then
#
# is ONE command spelled over two lines, and a line-at-a-time sweep sees neither
# half. Live count today is zero, so this is latent like the false positives
# were; it is closed for the same reason, and because under-reporting is the
# defect this whole part is about. Parts 260 and 460 already fold with this sed,
# so it is the house form rather than a new idea.
#
# A BACKSLASH FOLD CLOSES THE CLASS HERE, not merely the common case, and that
# is measured rather than assumed. bash also continues after a trailing `&&`,
# `||` or `|` with no backslash, and every sweep in this tree folds on `\` only,
# which has cost two sessions an else-less count before now. It cannot hide THIS
# pattern, because those operators join COMMANDS and not a command's words:
#
#     [ -d                       `[: missing ']'` at runtime. Broken code,
#       "/tmp/.git" ]            not a continuation; nothing to find.
#     [ -d "/tmp" ] &&           1 unfolded. The test is whole on its own line.
#       [ -d "/tmp/.git" ]
#     [ -d \                     0 unfolded, 1 folded.
#       "/tmp/.git" ]
#     if [ -d "$(dirname \       0 unfolded, 1 folded.
#        "/tmp/x")/.git" ]
#
# Driven, all four parsed and run. Splitting `[`'s operands needs a backslash,
# so for a pattern anchored on `[` or `test` plus `-d` this fold is complete.
