# ---- no suite pipes a captured string into an early-exit reader (#486) -------
#
# `echo "$s" | grep -q PATTERN` under `set -o pipefail` answers "not found" when
# the WRITER fails, whatever the string contained. The reader exits as soon as it
# has its answer, the writer takes EPIPE, and pipefail calls the pipeline failed.
# The `&&` arm never runs and the helper reports absence.
#
# This is not theoretical and it is not new here. #473 found it in this file's own
# membership test, and it came back in native_agg.sh, where it reported "the
# metadata aggregate node did not run" on PG18 CI for a plan that contained the
# node -- a red that reads exactly like a planner regression in the area #133 and
# #140 live in. The tell was a `Broken pipe` line beside a result the same run's
# summary contradicted.
#
# The failure direction is what makes it worth a rule: it always reports the
# thing you were looking for as ABSENT, which is the answer that sends someone
# looking for a defect that is not there.
#
# The control below runs first, because a rule with no demonstrated failure is a
# style preference, and this one is not.

# The string CONTAINS the pattern, on its first line, in both arms. Only the
# answers differ. Written large on purpose: at a few kilobytes the write fits in
# the pipe buffer and completes before the reader can exit, which is why this
# shape passes almost every time and then does not.

# The rule itself. A pipeline whose left side is a shell builtin writing a
# captured string, and whose right side is a reader that exits early AND whose
# EXIT STATUS is the answer being read. That last part is the whole rule: the
# damage is a wrong verdict, not a wrong message.
#
# So `grep -q` is in scope and `| head -1` inside a diagnostic string is not.
# Those exist here (analyze_stats.sh prints a plan's first line that way) and
# they can lose their pipeline's status without changing any check, because the
# substitution is used as text. They are left alone on purpose rather than
# missed; the worst they do is print to stderr.
#
# Scoped to echo and printf deliberately for the same reason. A pipeline out of
# psql or a file is a different question with a different answer, and a rule that
# flagged those too would be argued with rather than kept.
