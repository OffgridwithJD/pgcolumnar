# ---- the sanitizer subset must cover the C-level encoding selftest -----------
#
# test/run_san.sh runs a SUBSET of the suites, and a suite that is not in it is
# not sanitized -- silently, since nothing reports the omission.
#
# encode_invariants is the only suite that drives pgcolumnar_debug_encoding_selftest,
# which exercises bitunpack at every width 1..64 across counts 1,2,3,7,8,9,17,64,129
# plus a derived count per width. That matters because it is the only fixture that
# crosses bitunpack's fast/tail boundary in both directions: nFast is 0 until the
# encoded body reaches nine bytes, so small counts are all tail. Measured with a
# probe build, counting backends that reached the tail loop:
#
#     encode_invariants  21
#     differential        0
#
# differential's chunks are large enough that nFast == n throughout, so a
# sanitizer pass that includes differential and not encode_invariants covers one
# of bitunpack's two paths -- over exactly the code #514 rewrote.
#
# Asked as "every suite that drives the selftest" rather than by name, so moving
# the selftest to another suite cannot quietly narrow this.
# Ask the runner rather than parsing the source (CONTEXT.md, #473) -- but with
# PGC_SAN_SUITES cleared, because the claim under test is about the SHIPPED
# DEFAULT, not about whatever an operator overrode it with for one run.
#
# Both halves are load-bearing and each fixes a different defect. Asking the
# runner means this cannot drift from what run_san.sh actually iterates. Clearing
# the variable means a developer with an override exported does not get a red
# from a check that is not about their override -- which is what a plain
# --list-suites here produces, verified: with PGC_SAN_SUITES='smoke differential'
# the runner reports no encode_invariants and this check would fail while the
# shipped default is perfectly correct.

# ---- NOT a check: FSST slack coverage, and why there is no arm for it --------
#
# decode_fsst_shared stores each symbol as one fixed 8-byte write and allocates
# FSST_DECODE_SLACK bytes past rawLen so the tail of that write stays inside the
# allocation (#768). Nothing in the ordinary matrix can see the slack removed:
# the over-write lands 1 to 7 bytes past a palloc'd chunk, which does not fault
# and changes no answer. The sanitizer catches it precisely -- with the slack
# deleted, write_fsst_compressed reports
# `heap-buffer-overflow ... columnar_encoding.c in decode_fsst_shared`.
#
# I wrote an arm here requiring the subset to keep a suite that drives FSST, and
# then removed it, because it cannot fail. `encode_effort = full` is the DEFAULT,
# so FSST decoding is exercised by essentially every suite that stores text, and
# the subset holds many: native_encoding, write_fsst_compressed, differential,
# arrow_export among them. Measured: deleting all three of the suites I first
# named from the subset left the check green, because others still matched.
#
# So the coverage is not at risk in the way an arm here would guard, and a check
# that cannot go red is worse than none -- it reads as protection. The comment
# stays because the REASON matters: if the sanitizer subset ever narrowed to
# suites that store no varlena data, the slack would lose its only detector.
