# A preflight that built nothing must not report PASSED.
#
# test/build_all_versions.sh answers "does this compile on every major". Its
# verdict reads only `failed`, and only a build that RUNS and FAILS sets it. A
# pg_config that is not executable takes the `continue` above that, so a run
# where every major was skipped reaches the end with failed=0 and prints
# PASSED, exit 0, having invoked no compiler at all.
#
# FOUND THE EXPENSIVE WAY, 2026-08-28 (#809). The defaults are /usr/local/pg15,
# pg16, pg17, pgsql and pg19. The audit container has none of them -- every
# assert build there is a-suffixed, pg15a through pg19a -- so the no-argument
# form can never build anything on that machine. It was recorded as a green
# five-major preflight for a pull request and caught only by reading the body
# above the verdict:
#
#   SKIP  /usr/local/pg15/bin/pg_config      (not executable)     [x5]
#   build_all_versions.sh: PASSED
#
# WHY A COUNT RATHER THAN A STRICTER DEFAULT LIST. Hard-coding this box's paths
# would move the problem to the next machine. The verdict is what is wrong: it
# collapses "built five" and "built none" into one word. Its sibling
# run_all_versions.sh already prints `versions run: N of M configured`, and that
# line is the whole fix -- a reader sees the denominator, and zero is refused.
#
# SCOPE. This pins the all-skip case only. Whether a PARTIAL run (three of five
# present) should fail or warn is a judgement about how people run this, and is
# deliberately not decided here.

# ---- and it must leave no object tree behind, on a box with no pg_config -----
#
# #1219. The script's LAST act is a clean, and its comment says why: "Leave no
# object tree behind from whichever major happened to be last: the next build
# against a different major would link objects compiled for this one." It was
# written as
#
#     make -C "$SRCDIR" clean >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
#
# with no PG_CONFIG and its failure swallowed. PGXS resolves `pg_config` from
# PATH, so on a box with no packaged one this make fails, the `|| true` eats it,
# and the tree keeps the LAST major's objects while the script still prints
# PASSED. Measured, same tree, pg18a then pg19a:
#
#     normal PATH              built 2 of 2  PASSED   objects left:  0
#     PATH with no pg_config   built 2 of 2  PASSED   objects left: 36
#
# The consequence is bounded -- #1221's DWARF provenance catches the foreign
# objects on the next suite and cleans them -- so this costs a rebuild rather
# than a wrong install. What it does not cost is nothing, and the comment
# promises something it does not always do.
#
# THE SWEEP DOES NOT DEPEND ON pg_config AT ALL, and that is the fix rather than
# passing one: objects live in src/ AND objstore/, a `make clean` needs PGXS
# loaded to do anything, and a clean whose failure is swallowed cannot be
# distinguished from one that worked. So it removes by find and then VERIFIES,
# and the verdict is a value this part can judge.
