# ---- the port walk must WRAP, not walk off the ceiling (#548) ---------------
#
# pgc_pick_free_port seeds a base from the PID and scans forward. It used to
# `break` at hi, so a seed near the ceiling got a truncated scan: the failure
# needs the ports at the top of the band to be BUSY, and then the walk gives up
# with the whole band free beneath it. About 1 replication run in 2000, which
# across five majors is roughly 1 CI run in 400, presenting as an unattributable
# red that moved between majors.
#
# The band must be made busy to test this. A first version of these checks asked
# the picker for a port with the band EMPTY, where the old code also succeeds --
# they passed with the no-wrap walk restored, which is to say they tested
# nothing. The stub is the whole point.
