# ---- a residual must be counted, never derived by subtraction ---------------
#
# #999 and #1006, filed independently by both sessions off the same runs. Every
# PG 17 matrix report on main printed a count that cannot exist:
#
#     suites that ran: 243 of 252 (skipped: 9, incomplete: 0)
#     of those, 248 accounted for their checks and -5 did not
#
# MINUS FIVE SUITES. PG 18 printed -2 on the same day, from 246 ran.
#
# THE TWO TERMS COUNT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. `suites_ran` counts suites that ran,
# so a skipped suite is not in it. `_acc_any` counts suites whose LOG shows an
# accounting line, over all registered suites -- and a skipped suite still prints
# one, because `check_skip` is followed by `pgc_summary` and `pgc_summary` emits
# the accounting line on every exit path before it decides the status. So a
# skipped-but-accounted suite is in the second and not the first, and subtracting
# one from the other goes negative once there are more than none.
#
# WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT, AND IT IS THE POINT OF THIS PART. The residual was
# DERIVED BY SUBTRACTION rather than counted, so the partition closes
# arithmetically whatever the inputs are: 248 + (-5) = 243. An
# `inputs == sum(buckets)` arm passes on that line for ANY two numbers. The house
# rule it breaks is written eight lines below the counter it governs, in
# `pgc_summary` itself:
#
#     A MEASUREMENT, not an identity. The failed count is its own counter rather
#     than `CHECKS - PASSED - UNRUN`, because a derived third term makes
#     `P + (N-P-U) + U = N` true for ANY values.
#
# The suite-level breakdown committed exactly the error the check-level
# accounting was written to prevent.
#
# AND THE EXISTING GUARD CANNOT REACH IT. Part 390 pins where the NUMERATOR comes
# from with `grep -c 'of those, $_acc_any accounted for their checks'`. That is a
# grep for the source line's text. It says nothing about the other term and
# nothing about whether the printed result is a number a count can take.
#
# SO THIS PART TESTS THE SET, NOT THE TEXT. The residual is now a set difference
# computed by `pgc_ran_without_accounting`, which is evalled out of the runner and
# fed crafted inputs here -- including the live shape, where the accounted set is
# a strict superset of the ran set. A set difference cannot go negative, so the
# defect becomes unrepresentable rather than merely detected.
#
# The skipped-but-accounted suites get their own named category, because they are
# not a debt and were being folded silently into a number phrased as one.
