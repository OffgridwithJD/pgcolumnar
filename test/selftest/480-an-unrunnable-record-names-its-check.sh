# ---- an unrunnable record must name the check it stands in for --------------
#
# #1040. `check_unrunnable NAME REASON DETAIL` gives one check the honesty
# `pgc_skip` gives a whole suite: the check did not run, and the reader is told
# WHICH. That only works if the record carries the name the check uses when it
# DOES run. Where the two spellings differ the property has TWO ledger keys and
# which one appears depends on runtime state -- in `hilbert_locality` it depended
# on whether that box's two partitions came out different that day, so the key
# was a function of the data.
#
# THIS IS PART 470's PROPERTY ONE HELPER OVER. 470 asks whether a skip LOOP still
# names the arms its sibling branch emits. This asks whether an unrunnable record
# names a check the same file asserts anywhere.
#
# WHY A GUARD AND NOT JUST THE RENAME. The convention is already near-universal
# and that is exactly what makes a lapse invisible: 23 of 25 call sites carry the
# runnable name (`hilbert_cluster` 9 of 9, `projection_rewrite` 11 of 11), so a
# reader skimming a new refusal branch sees nothing unusual in a shorter name.
# Both halves of a two-branch site are rarely read together.
#
# `check_skip` IS NOT SWEPT and that is a finding rather than an omission. A
# skipped arm has no runnable counterpart by construction -- the name IS the arm
# -- so 21 of its 23 call sites have no twin and always will. Sweeping it would
# report 21 mismatches that are all correct code.
#
# THE POSITIVE CONTROL BELOW IS THE POINT OF THE PART. A sweep that matched
# nothing reports the same zero as a corpus in agreement, and this guard's steady
# state is zero, so nothing else would ever distinguish the two. The fixture arms
# drive the real tool over a file whose answer is known.
