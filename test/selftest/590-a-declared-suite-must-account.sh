# ---- a suite that declares accounting must produce it on every exit (#1233) --
#
# Every one of the 252 suites that calls pgc_setup also calls pgc_summary, so
# every one of them DECLARES accounting. pgc_setup has EIGHT exit paths and
# calls pgc_summary on none of them, so on any of those eight a declared suite
# exited without producing the line it promised.
#
# NOT A FALSE PASS: rc is 1 and the FATAL is correct. What was lost is the
# machine-readable line, and six readers consume it -- run_all_versions.sh's
# reconciliation, pgc_vacuity.py, test_check_records.py,
# test_residual_is_counted.py, test_suite_accounting.py and smoke.sh. To every
# one of them a declared suite with no accounting is indistinguishable from a
# suite that died mid-run. run_all_versions.sh already names the case in the
# reconciliation's own comment, so the comment is older than the defect.
#
# THE REPAIR IS THE TRAP, WHICH IS ONE SITE RATHER THAN EIGHT, and these arms
# are about that choice as much as about the output: a per-exit patch cannot
# cover the ninth exit, and the trap covers it by construction.

#
# A selftest part is SOURCED, so an assignment here clobbers the live counters
# of the run it is part of. The first version set PGC_CHECKS=7 and left them
# set: the selftest's final summary read `checks run: 10 ... 1 unrunnable` and
# `INCOMPLETE` on a run that had executed over eleven hundred checks, and it
# exited 67. Every arm in this part passed while it happened. An implausible
# TOTAL was the only tell, and `pgc_reconcile_records` in run_all_versions.sh
# computes exactly that -- it did not fire because a bare
# `bash test/harness_selftest.sh` never reaches it, which is how both sessions
# drive suites while developing.
#
# SAVED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE EACH BLOCK, not once at the top. A single snapshot
# taken at the start and restored later would wipe the counts of every arm that
# ran in between -- a lossy restore that looks like a careful one. The second
# version did that and the assertion below caught it: got 1145 want 1144.

# AND WHAT A READER CONCLUDES FROM IT, which is the gap this change came through
# (@OffgridwithJD, review). The arms above assert the line is EMITTED and that
# the reader's pattern MATCHES it. Neither asserts what anyone DECIDES from it,
# and the first version of this change collapsed three states into one verdict
# for every consumer while every arm here stayed green.
#
# Before the trap emitted accounting, the presence of that line meant "this
# suite reached its summary", because pgc_summary was the only thing that
# printed it. `yes` keeps that meaning; `terminated` is the new state and gets
# its own value rather than being folded into either neighbour. Folding it into
# `yes` loses the mid-run death -- a `set -e` abort RUNS the EXIT trap, so only
# SIGKILL leaves no accounting at all. Folding it into `no` restores the false
# "declared but never accounted" the trap was added to remove.
#
# The reader is EVALLED out of run_all_versions.sh rather than restated, per
# selftest 320.

# AND THE FALSE-POSITIVE SURFACE, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED EMPTY.
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS ARM CLAIMED NO DECLARED SUITE HAS A BARE EXIT AND
# WANTED 0. That was false: there are about thirty such sites.
#
# IT READ 0 BECAUSE THE `grep` THAT COUNTED IT WAS NOT GNU grep. On the author's
# host `grep` is a shell FUNCTION wrapping another tool, and it returns 0 for
# `(^|[^_[:alnum:]])exit( |$)` where `/usr/bin/grep` returns 3 on the same input
# and 2 on test/smoke.sh. The pattern is correct. The instrument was not, and
# the first diagnosis written here blamed GNU ERE semantics for a defect that
# does not exist -- which would have sent the next reader to the regex instead
# of to their own shell. Corrected by @OffgridwithJD, who measured three greps
# against one input rather than accepting the explanation.
#
# Suites are unaffected: they run in the container against GNU grep 3.12. This
# bites only measurements made by hand, which is where the claims get made.
# The container's own run of this arm said 30 and was dismissed as litter; the
# container was right.
#
# WHAT IS ACTUALLY TRUE, and it is the property that matters: every bare exit in
# a declared suite is either an ERROR path, which SHOULD be marked TERMINATED,
# or is preceded by pgc_summary, in which case the flag above suppresses the
# second summary. The dangerous case is a DELIBERATE clean exit with no summary,
# because that is correct behaviour this would mislabel.
#
# There are FOUR `exit 0` sites in declared suites and every one reaches its
# summary first, by one route or the other:
#
#     isolation           pgc_summary on the previous line
#     objstore_module     pgc_summary on the previous line
#     temporal            pgc_summary on the previous line
#     logical_subscriber  pgc_summary on the SAME line
#
# Both routes are checked, which is why the arm looks at the same line as well
# as the one above it. A first count said three and missed logical_subscriber,
# for the same reason as everything else in this comment: it was taken with the
# wrapper rather than with GNU grep.
#
# This is what would break if a fifth were added without a summary.
