# ---- a test script must be runnable the way it is documented (#852, #856) ----
#
# Every document that tells a reader how to run a script spells it as a command:
# `test/temporal.sh /path/to/pg_config`, `PGC_RUN_UPGRADE=1
# test/run_all_versions.sh`, `bench/run_bench_fsst.sh /path/to/pg_config`. 103 of
# the 262 top-level scripts under test/ were mode 100644 at the base #853 landed
# on, so 30 of those documented invocations died with `Permission denied` before
# running a single statement.
#
# THE MATRIX NEVER SAW IT, AND THAT IS THE POINT. ci.yml and nightly.yml both
# call `bash test/run_all_versions.sh`, and the runner launches each suite as
# `bash "$builddir/test/${s}.sh"`. An interpreter named on the command line does
# not consult the execute bit, so a suite's own mode is invisible to every green
# run in this project's history. Those runs are honest. The gap is between the
# documentation and a shell, and only a check that reads the MODE can stand in it.
#
# THE RULE IS A BICONDITIONAL: A SHEBANG AND THE EXECUTE BIT GO TOGETHER.
#
#   A. A file that declares an interpreter must be executable. It has said it is
#      meant to be run, and a mode that forbids running it contradicts the file's
#      own first line. This is #852's defect.
#   B. A file that is executable must declare an interpreter. Otherwise the mode
#      promises something the file cannot deliver: what would `./foo.py` even run
#      under?
#   C. And a script a document names as a bare command must be executable,
#      whatever its first line says. This is the only rule anchored on prose, and
#      it is here to close the hole B leaves: delete a documented command's
#      shebang AND its bit and A and B both fall silent, because the file is then
#      internally consistent and still broken for the reader.
#
# A file with NEITHER a shebang nor the bit passes, and that is deliberate. It is
# a fragment meant to be sourced, and it is the only self-consistent way to say
# so. #856 is why this is spelled out: an earlier revision of this part flagged
# every file without a shebang, which left a sourced fragment no way to be
# correct -- dropping the shebang moved it from one red to another. The header
# then documented "drop its shebang and say why" as the way out, and that way out
# did not exist. bench/cb_guards.sh is the file that proved it: sourced by
# bench/run_clickbench.sh and test/bench_guards.sh, its header saying "Sourced,
# not executed" since the day it was written, and unfixable under the old rule.
#
# WHY THE POPULATION IS "EVERY DIRECTORY THAT HOLDS A DOCUMENTED ENTRY POINT".
# Today that is test/ and bench/. #852 was found in test/ and fixed there, and
# bench/ was left out -- while docs/benchmarks.md names five bench/ scripts as
# bare commands. All five are 100755 today, so all five work: correct by habit,
# with nothing checking it, which is exactly what test/ was before #852. A
# directory that documents an entry point earns the same guard as the one that
# already had it.
#
# AND THE BICONDITIONAL REMOVED THE NEED FOR EXEMPTIONS, WHICH IS THE REAL
# SIMPLIFICATION HERE. The old rule flagged every file without a shebang, so the
# two directories full of sourced fragments and data had to be pruned by path or
# they would have reddened the sweep wholesale. Under A and B a fragment with
# neither a shebang nor the bit is CORRECT, so nothing needs excusing:
#
#   test/selftest/   31 scripts, every one already ok -- no shebang, no bit
#   test/fixtures/   14 .sh/.py, one ok and thirteen that #856 gave the bit
#
# Measured, both directories, before the prune was removed. Nothing is excluded
# now, so nothing is concealed: the thirteen fixture host tools that the old
# exemption hid in a state this rule calls wrong are inside the population and
# the suite would redden if any of them lost its bit again.
