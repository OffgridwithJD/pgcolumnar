# pgColumnar concurrency regression test (tracking issue #4).
#
# Deletes are recorded by merging bits into a single shared pgcolumnar.delete_vector
# heap tuple per (storage id, stripe, chunk group). Before the fix, the delete
# path did an unguarded read-modify-write of that tuple: two transactions
# deleting different rows in the SAME chunk group could both read the old mask
# and then collide, so one transaction's delete bits were lost (a deleted row
# stayed visible) or the second deleter aborted with "tuple concurrently
# updated" / a duplicate-key error. The fix serializes the read-modify-write of
# a given chunk group with a transaction-scoped chunk-group lock and re-reads
# the committed mask before merging, so both sets of delete bits survive.
#
# This test forces the exact interleaving deterministically. It relies on the
# fact that a columnar DELETE flushes its delete marks to the catalog at the
# statement's executor-end, inside the still-open transaction. So:
#
#   session 1:  BEGIN; DELETE row A;   -- flush runs here, holds the chunk-group
#                                         write and its lock, uncommitted
#   session 2:  BEGIN; DELETE row B;   -- flush blocks: same chunk group
#   (barrier: wait until session 2 is blocked on a lock, via pg_stat_activity)
#   session 1:  COMMIT;                -- releases; session 2 unblocks
#   session 2:  COMMIT;
#
# After both commit, BOTH rows must be gone. Before the fix, session 2 either
# lost its bit or aborted, leaving its row visible; the final count then differs
# and the check fails. The barrier is a poll on pg_stat_activity for a real lock
# wait, not a fixed sleep, so the interleaving is forced, not raced.
#
# Two chunk-group states are exercised:
#   A. a delete_vector tuple already exists for the chunk group (update path)
#   B. no delete_vector tuple exists yet     (first-delete insert race)
#
# It also checks the intended concurrency is preserved: two deletes to
# DIFFERENT chunk groups do not block each other.
#
# Written fresh for pgColumnar; it reuses no upstream test file or expected
# output. Derived from the format/interface spec and the public PostgreSQL API.
#
# Usage:
#   test/concurrency.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#
# PG_CONFIG defaults to /usr/local/pg17/bin/pg_config. Run as a user that may
# "runuser -u postgres" (e.g. root) when the current user is not postgres.


# portlib.sh alone, not lib.sh: this suite carries its own harness, and the port
# band is needed before any of it runs. Sourcing portlib twice is harmless.
# lib.sh for the check vocabulary (#965). It sources portlib.sh itself
# (lib.sh:110), so this is a superset of what was here, and its top level is
# assignments and function definitions only, so sourcing it starts nothing.

# A TIMEOUT IS A CHECK RESULT (#965). These paths printed `FAIL  timeout waiting
# for ...`, set the suite-local `fail` and returned -- touching neither PGC_CHECKS
# nor the record stream. A failing run then reconciled as `N passed + 0 failed =
# N`: an aggregate that BALANCES while asserting zero failures on a run that
# failed. That is worse than invisibility, because a missing number can be noticed
# and a balancing one cannot. Induced and measured rather than argued.
#
# THE NAME IS FIXED PER WAIT KIND, with the session and sentinel in pgc_record's
# REASON field. The ledger is keyed on (suite, part, name), so interpolating
# "$name/$label" into the name would mint rows nobody can enumerate and therefore
# nobody can seed.
#
# NO GREEN RUN EXECUTES THIS. It records only on the timeout path, so a passing
# suite emits nothing here and the record stream is unchanged.
