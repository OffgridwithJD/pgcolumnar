# pgColumnar: pgcolumnar.stats is usable by a table's owner, and only by a
# caller who may read the table (#560).
#
# stats() is documented as the function "most users" read, and it failed for the
# owner of the table being inspected: it is LANGUAGE sql and selects straight
# from pgcolumnar.row_group, delete_vector and zone_map, and the install script
# contains no GRANT, so those tables are owner-only and the owner of a COLUMNAR
# table is not their owner.
#
# The obvious fix is worse than the defect. GRANTing SELECT on the catalog to
# PUBLIC would publish pgcolumnar.zone_map, which stores per-column minimum,
# maximum and sum for every columnar table: actual column values. That is a
# larger disclosure than the usability bug it fixes.
#
# So the function runs SECURITY DEFINER and does the privilege check itself.
#
# THE TRAP THIS SUITE EXISTS TO CATCH. Inside a SECURITY DEFINER function the
# effective user is the function OWNER, so pg_class_aclcheck(relid, GetUserId(),
# ...) checks the superuser who installed the extension and returns ACLCHECK_OK
# for every relation in the database. It looks exactly like a correct check and
# refuses nobody. Measured on this build:
#
#   plain call    as t_id: cur=t_id     outer=t_id  sess=t_id
#   definer call  as t_id: cur=postgres outer=t_id  sess=t_id
#
# GetOuterUserId() is the caller. The "a role with no privilege is refused" arm
# below is what fails if that is ever changed back to GetUserId().
#
# Usage:  test/stats_privilege.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
