# pgColumnar fetch-path interrupt guard (#212).
#
# pgcolumnar_fetch_row is reached once per candidate item pointer by
# _bt_check_unique() during a unique INSERT, and each such call reads the
# row-group list out of the catalog (the unique check runs under SnapshotDirty,
# which #709's memo never serves). Before #212 that path had no CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS --
# the three checks already in columnar_reader.c are all on the scan/decode path,
# which a unique liveness check never enters -- so a unique INSERT whose conflict
# check did a lot of fetch work could not be cancelled and never noticed
# postmaster death. A backend spun there at 100% CPU for three days, outliving
# its cluster. The fix is one CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS at the top of the function.
#
# This check is structural, and on purpose. The behavioural proof -- with the
# guard the fetch loop cancels under a small statement_timeout (57014), without
# it the SAME statement runs to completion ignoring the timeout -- is real and is
# in the PR, but it is not a stable CI assertion: the loop only overruns a small
# timeout when the per-fetch catalog scan is paid enough times, the fixture that
# arranges that is O(dups^2) to build (each set-up delete pays the same scan), and
# the loop's exact length still shifts with build flags and catalog state enough
# to cross a 10 ms line either way. Pinning the guard's presence and placement is
# stable and is the actual regression: if someone removes it, this fails.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fetch_interrupt.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
