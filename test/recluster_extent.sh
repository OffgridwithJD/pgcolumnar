# pgColumnar online recluster ordered extent (#311).
#
# pgcolumnar.recluster reorders a relation under ShareUpdateExclusiveLock, so
# another session can insert while it works. Its output groups and the concurrent
# inserter's groups both take numbers above the ones it retires, and afterwards
# nothing about a group says which wrote it. That is why the rewrite reports the
# stripe ids it reserved, and why the run stops at the first live group it did
# not write.
#
# Two cheaper designs were rejected and this suite is what would catch either of
# them being adopted:
#
#   - marking through the highest live group number: counts the concurrent
#     inserter's group as ordered;
#   - marking by the row-number range the rewrite wrote: reservations interleave,
#     so a concurrent reservation lands strictly inside that range.
#
# Both over-claim, and over-claiming is the unsafe direction: it leaves a decayed
# table looking ordered, which costs every query against it.
#
# Usage:  test/recluster_extent.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# -------------------------------- the id-drawn-below case, deterministically

# The defect in #342: a concurrent writer draws its stripe id when it buffers its
# first row, so a writer that starts before the rewrite owns an id BELOW every id
# the rewrite draws. The rewrite's own ids stay consecutive, so a mark that is a
# bare upper bound sweeps that foreign group underneath it and counts unordered
# rows as ordered.
#
# The concurrent section above only hits this when the scheduler cooperates, which
# is why it failed on CI and not locally. This reproduces it with no timing at all:
# the writer holds its transaction open, so the ordering is forced rather than
# raced.
#
# The insert is deliberately smaller than stripe_row_limit. It draws its stripe id
# while buffering, but does not flush until commit -- so it does not hold the
# per-storage advisory lock that a flush takes to transaction end, and the rewrite
# is free to run to completion in the meantime.
