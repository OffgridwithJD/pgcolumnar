# pgColumnar ANALYZE column statistics (issue #154).
#
# ANALYZE used to report success and collect nothing: both analyze callbacks
# returned false, so pg_statistic stayed empty and every predicate was estimated
# with planner defaults. The sampler maps each block core chooses to the slice of
# its row group that the block stands for, and offers that slice's live rows.
#
# Eight things are asserted.
#
# 1. The statistics agree with a heap table on identical data. This is the
#    differential oracle the rest of the suite uses, and it is what catches a
#    sampling bias rather than a coding error.
#
# 2. The estimated row count is close to the true one. This is the check that
#    discriminates against the obvious wrong implementation. Treating a block as a
#    whole row group and offering all of its rows -- cluster sampling -- makes core
#    count those rows against the handful of blocks it visited, so reltuples is
#    inflated by roughly the number of blocks a group spans. Measured: 20,500,000
#    for a 1,000,000-row table, against 986,666 for the slice mapping -- a factor of
#    20 wrong against 1.3% low.
#
# 3. A heavily clustered table still estimates n_distinct correctly, which is the
#    hazard the design plan singles out. Worth keeping, but see the note below: it
#    does NOT discriminate on its own.
#
# 4. A join against a small table picks the same plan shape as the heap
#    equivalent, which is the consequence the whole issue is about.
#
# On check 3, honestly: the plan predicted that cluster sampling would
# underestimate n_distinct on a clustered table and that this check alone would
# catch it. It does not. Offering whole groups hands core far more rows than it
# asked for, so its reservoir ends up sampling most of the table and n_distinct
# comes out fine -- 1000 against a true 1001, no worse than the correct code. The
# defect is real but it surfaces in the row count, not the distribution, which is
# why check 2 exists and is the one to keep if either is ever dropped.
#
# Usage:  test/analyze_stats.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# It said the estimate is biased low by the share of the file that is not group
# data, and quoted 95.0% of the truth at 500,000 rows and 98.7% at 1,000,000.
# Those numbers were real, but their cause was not: a block was mapped to its row
# group by comparing a block offset that had COLUMNAR_FIRST_LOGICAL_OFFSET
# subtracted from it against a group offset that is already absolute, so every
# block landed two blocks low and the tail of the last group was never offered.
# Fixed in #189.
#

# --- 5. ANALYZE is not proportional to the table ------------------------------

# The sampler offers every row of every block core visits, so its cost is per row
# OFFERED, not per row kept. Fetching each of those by row number re-read the row
# group list from the catalog and re-located the row: ANALYZE on a 250,000-row,
# eight-column table ran over 200 seconds and did not get faster when the
# statistics target was lowered to 1, because lowering the target does not reduce
# the rows offered when the table has fewer blocks than the target.
#
# A wide table is the shape that shows it, since width drives bytes per row rather
# than row count, and past a point the decoded row group exceeds the fetch
# cache's size cap so every offered row re-decodes the whole group. The size
# below is chosen to sit past that point; measured on the unfixed build:
#
#     60,000 rows    526 ms
#    100,000 rows    705 ms
#    150,000 rows    over 1800 s        <- the cap is crossed
#
# and on the fixed build 341 ms against a 155 ms scan, which is why the threshold
# has room. The reference is a full scan of the same table: ANALYZE reads a
# sample and must not cost multiples of reading everything.

# --- 6. the fetch cost keeps the planner off an unclustered ordered index (#355) --
#
# An ordered index scan on a columnar table pays for the order by fetching each row

# ordering column is unclustered those rows are scattered across every group, so the
# scan decodes the table many times over -- but core prices the fetch as a page or
# two and picks the index to avoid a sort. pgcolumnar_index_fetch_penalty adds the
# decode cost, so a sort over the scan wins instead. Measured on the bench, an
# unclustered ORDER BY that took minutes on the index dropped to seconds once it
# sorted.
#
# The checks are behavioural (plan shape), and paired: the same query is planned
# with the penalty on and off, so the second is the premise of the first -- if the
# planner would not have taken the index without the penalty there is nothing for it

# --- 9. the penalty is bounded by a multiple of one scan (#376) ------------------
#
# The checks above assert direction. This one asserts magnitude, because #376 is not
# a wrong direction but an unbounded one.
#
# The model prices a fetch as a row-group decode times the rows the path returns.
# That is right when the plan above reads the whole path, and unbounded when it stops
# early. On the 100M fixture the penalty reached 502,598,685,066 against an
# un-penalized 2,427,872 -- 207,000x. A consumer reading 3,998 rows of 100,000,000
# still lost to a full scan and a sort: 44,058 ms taken against 769 ms refused.
#
# A LIMIT is the shape core can show. Ten rows cost ten fetches, which is far less
# than sorting the table, so the index is the right plan. Before the bound the
# penalty was large enough to refuse it even for ten rows.
