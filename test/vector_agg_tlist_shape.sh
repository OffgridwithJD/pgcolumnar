# The vectorized aggregate accepts a target list that CONTAINS aggregates, not
# only one that IS them (#755).
#
# The ungrouped vectorized path used to require every target-list entry to be a
# bare Aggref. An entry that merely contained one -- `count(*)::text`,
# `avg(a)+avg(b)`, `round(avg(a),2)`, `max(a)-min(a)` -- fell off the path
# entirely, and on an unfiltered columnar table that is the difference between
# answering from the zone maps and scanning the whole relation. Measured on
# 8,000,000 rows before the change: count(*) 0.030 ms against count(*)::text
# 634.1 ms.
#
# THE RISK IS A WRONG ANSWER, NOT A SLOW ONE. The node emits one bare aggregate
# per output column and a projection above it computes the expressions, so a
# mis-built projection returns the wrong column, the wrong aggregate, or the
# right value in the wrong place. Every arm below therefore asserts the ANSWER
# against a heap table holding identical rows, and asserts the plan separately.
# A plan check alone cannot see a wrong result; an answer check alone cannot see
# that the fast path was never taken.
#
# Usage:  test/vector_agg_tlist_shape.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# --- the surface this change OPENS ------------------------------------------
#
# Before the relaxation these never reached pgcolumnar_classify_aggref at all:
# the tlist-shape gate refused them first, because each is an aggregate wrapped
# in something. Now the shape gate passes and classify_aggref is the ONLY thing
# between a modifier the node cannot represent and a wrong answer. It rejects
# aggorder, aggdistinct, aggfilter and aggvariadic in its first condition; these
# arms are what keep that true.
#
# THE NODE DOES NOT FAIL ON A MODIFIER IT CANNOT REPRESENT. IT IGNORES IT AND
# RETURNS THE UNMODIFIED AGGREGATE. Measured by removing aggdistinct and
# aggfilter from that condition, on 20,000 rows:
#
#                                   correct   with the refusal removed
#   count(*) FILTER (WHERE a > 5)     8,000            20,000
#   count(DISTINCT b)                     7            20,000
#   count(*)                         20,000            20,000
#
# Both collapse to the unmodified aggregate. A FILTER that removes 60% of the
# rows returns the count of all of them, and a DISTINCT over 7 values returns
# 20,000. No error, no plan tell, and a number that looks entirely plausible --
# which is the worst failure direction available and the reason the refusal has
# to live in classify_aggref rather than be inferred from a shape gate that used
# to hide these before they got there.
