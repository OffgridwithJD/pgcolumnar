# pgColumnar Hilbert clustering: does the curve actually buy range locality?
# (issue #889, the measurement half.)
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
#
# test/hilbert_curve.sh pins the CURVE in C, by its mathematical properties and
# by frozen bytes. test/hilbert_cluster.sh pins the SQL SURFACE: the two verbs,
# the recorded kind, the gates and the daemon. Neither of them can tell whether
# laying a table on the Hilbert curve does the one thing the feature was added
# for -- put two-dimensionally near rows in the same row group, so that a
# two-dimensional range predicate has fewer groups to open.
#
# This file is that question and only that question. It builds one fixture,
# lays it out twice -- once with pgcolumnar.cluster() (Z-order) and once with
# pgcolumnar.cluster_hilbert() -- and counts the engine's own
# "Columnar Chunk Groups Read" over 60 window placements at each of four window
# sizes. The counts are PINNED AS EXACT INTEGERS.
#
# WHY EXACT INTEGERS AND NOT A THRESHOLD -- AND WHAT EACH INSTRUMENT CATCHES
#
# A threshold is the thing someone lowers when it reddens. "Hilbert reads at
# most 0.6x the groups Z-order does" survives a regression that costs half the
# benefit, and it survives it silently. An exact pin cannot be lowered without
# saying so, and it names which number moved.
#
# What an exact pin is NOT is automatically the sensitive instrument in this
# file. The eight integers were mutation-tested to find out what they, and only
# they, catch. Measured, not assumed:
#
#	- A CHANGED CURVE is caught by the DIGEST PINS in arm 2, about two hundred
#	  lines above the integers, and the integers add nothing to it. Two
#	  independently built, valid Hilbert re-orientations -- a point reflection
#	  inside cluster_hilbert_transpose, and a swap of the clustering axes
#	  before the transpose -- each moved the Hilbert digest AND all four
#	  Hilbert integers on the same run (h=117/202/403/1301 and
#	  h=130/208/409/1316 against pins of 118/209/402/1313). That is structural
#	  rather than a lucky choice of mutation: the counts are a deterministic
#	  function of the group boxes, which the digest hashes, of the 60 fixed
#	  origins, and of the skip logic. So for a changed curve the integers are a
#	  strictly weaker copy of a check the suite already makes upstream.
#	  Re-pinning arm 2 and arm 8 together after a deliberate curve change is
#	  right, but the digest is the arm that did the work.
#	- A CHANGED READER, AT AN UNCHANGED LAYOUT, is what only the integers
#	  catch. It is their own domain and it is why they are here. Refusing to
#	  skip odd-numbered row groups in src/columnar_reader.c left BOTH digests
#	  exactly at their pins and arms 1 and 3-7 green, and moved all eight
#	  integers (z=4144/4196/4317/4848, h=4083/4133/4228/4678).
#	- A CHANGED ROW MULTISET is NAMED by arm 1 and by nothing else. Loading the
#	  Hilbert arm from a differently seeded 200,000-row source over the same
#	  square moved the Hilbert digest, all four Hilbert integers (220/330/567/
#	  1603) and all four margins -- but not one of those arms says WHY, and a
#	  reader looking at moved integers would go hunting in the curve. Arm 1 is
#	  what says the two arms no longer hold the same rows. Its SECOND check is
#	  the one that survives the case where both loads went equally wrong:
#	  loading both arms with OFFSET 1 keeps "the identical row multiset" green
#	  and reddens "it is the source's multiset" and "both arms hold every
#	  source row" (399998 against 400000), while the measurement below refuses
#	  and the integers say nothing at all. So none of the three instruments is
#	  redundant to the others, and a reader who drops arm 1 or the digest pins
#	  as "already covered by the pins" is not covered.
#	- THE GROSS CASE -- the transpose gutted, so cluster_hilbert() silently
#	  lays Z-order -- is caught by arm 2 alone. The integers never execute:
#	  arm 8 refuses the measurement and prints sixteen UNRUN lines. A wall of
#	  UNMET_PRECONDITION here means the curve collapsed, not that the suite
#	  broke.
#
# The pins are the measurement, not a target -- if one moves, the correct
# response is to find out what moved it and then, if the new layout is better,
# re-pin with the new numbers beside the reason.
#
# WHY h < z IS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHAT THE MARGIN FLOOR IS FOR
#
# Alongside the pins, and separately, h < z is asserted AT EVERY BOX SIZE, and
# so is the MARGIN. An earlier version of this header told the reader that "the
# pins moved but h < z still holds" means the layout merely changed. THAT RULE
# WAS FALSE and it was reddened. The reader mutation above moves all eight
# integers, keeps h < z PASSING at every box, and takes z/h from 2.0424 to
# 1.0149 at box 2000: Hilbert won by 61 groups out of 4,144 and the suite
# printed PASS. A maintainer following the old rule would have re-pinned and
# accepted a change that took the feature's benefit from 2.04x to 1.01x.
#
# So h < z says only that Hilbert was not BEATEN. The per-box floor beside it
# says Hilbert still wins by the margin these numbers were measured at. Read
# the three arms together:
#
#	pins move, margin holds   the layout changed; find what moved it, re-pin.
#	margin fails              most of the benefit is gone, whatever h < z says.
#	h < z fails               HILBERT STOPPED WINNING, the worst of the three.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT CLAIM
#
#	- NOT that Hilbert is faster. Nothing here is timed. The unit is groups
#	  read, which is a count the engine reports about its own work; wall clock
#	  on this hardware is not a fair instrument and is not used.
#	- NOT that Hilbert wins on every workload. It measures square windows over
#	  two uniformly distributed int columns. A one-dimensional predicate, a
#	  skewed distribution, a non-square window or a different column count is a
#	  different measurement and this suite says nothing about any of them.
#	- NOT that Hilbert wins on every fixture. Arm 4 below is a fixture where it
#	  provably does not, and it is in here as a control precisely so that the
#	  win reported by arms 8a-8d cannot be read as a universal one.
#	- NOT anything about the curve's mathematics or the SQL surface. Those are
#	  the two suites named above and this one does not repeat them.
#
# THREE DEFECTS THIS SHAPE EXISTS TO AVOID. Each was found in the pilot that
# produced these numbers, and each produced a plausible ratio while measuring
# something else:
#
#	1. THE TWO ARMS MUST HOLD THE IDENTICAL ROWS. The pilot ran a random()
#	   INSERT once per table, so the arms held DIFFERENT DATA and the ratio was
#	   a fact about the data rather than about the curve. Hence the heap table
#	   `src`, materialised once, from which both arms load -- and hence arm 1,
#	   which asserts the row multisets are equal rather than assuming that two
#	   INSERTs from one source produced one.
#
#	2. THE PARTITION DIGEST MUST BE ORDER-INDEPENDENT. The pilot's first digest
#	   ordered each column's min/max BY group_number, so it reported "the
#	   partitions differ" when the two curves had merely NUMBERED the same
#	   groups differently. Under that digest the dense dyadic control (arm 4)
#	   PASSED its premise and went on to report a ratio, which is exactly the
#	   case the control exists to catch. The digest below groups by
#	   group_number, builds one string per group from BOTH columns' min and max,
#	   and then sorts THOSE STRINGS before hashing. Two identical partitions
#	   hash equal however they are numbered.
#
#	3. A SINGLE WINDOW ORIGIN IS NOT A MEASUREMENT. At one origin the pilot's
#	   four differences were 1, 1, 0 and 1 groups, and the reported 2.000 ratio
#	   came off a single group. Hence 60 deterministic placements per box, and
#	   hence the assertion that all 60 were actually measured -- a grep that
#	   matched 3 lines and summed them would otherwise report a smaller total
#	   and read as a better result.
#
# WHY THE CONTROLS ARE NOT OPTIONAL
#
# Arms 8a-8d divide one number by another and call the quotient a benefit. That
# is only meaningful if the two arms differ IN THE LAYOUT and in nothing else,
# so the suite refuses to report the measurement at all unless arm 2 has
# established that the two partitions really are two different partitions. Arm 3
# proves that refusal can fire: two tables laid out by the SAME verb produce
# IDENTICAL digests, so the digest is reporting the curve rather than reporting
# that any two tables differ. Arm 4 is the degenerate fixture the design
# predicted -- a dense dyadic grid, where the two curves cut the same blocks --
# and there the digests are identical too, on real data, from the same
# instrument.

#
# DELIBERATELY NOT REGISTERED in test/run_all_versions.sh yet. Registering it is
# part of the PR that lands it in the matrix; harness_selftest.sh sweeps
# test/*.sh and asserts every suite is registered, so this file makes that arm
# red until then.

# have to hold before a difference in them is a difference in LAYOUT:
#
#	5. the query planned as a columnar scan on BOTH arms -- a fallback would
#	   read no groups at all and report nothing to sum;
#	6. the predicates were pushed down AND USABLE on both arms. "Pushed-Down
#	   Filters" counts what the reader was handed; a key it could not build a
#	   skip predicate from excludes no group at all while still being reported
#	   as pushed down (#477). Usable is the number that says skipping is
#	   possible, so a zero here would mean both arms read everything and the
#	   ratio would be 1.0 for a reason that is not about the curve;
#	7. the two arms have the same number of groups TO read. A ratio between two
#	   different denominators is not a ratio.

# ARM 8  THE MEASUREMENT
# =============================================================================
#
# Reported only if arm 2 established a curve difference. This is the refusal the
# header describes: with no difference in layout there is nothing for a ratio to
# be about, and printing one anyway is how the pilot's first version produced
# numbers for the dense grid.
#
# AND THE REFUSAL IS WHAT ANSWERS THE GROSS CASE. With the Hilbert transpose
# gutted, so that cluster_hilbert() lays Z-order, arm 2 reddens twice and every
# check below refuses: sixteen UNRUN lines and "39 passed + 2 failed + 16
# unrunnable = 57", the run exiting 1 because a failure outranks an incomplete.
# A reader who sees that wall of UNMET_PRECONDITION is looking at a collapsed
# curve, not at a broken suite, and the two failures naming it are arm 2's.

# The pins, and the margin floor beside each one. Measured on main f2af080,
# PG 18.4, identical on two consecutive runs of the fixture above, and
# reproduced from a clean tree on 2026-09-09. box:zorder:hilbert:floor.
#
# THE FLOOR IS NOT THE THRESHOLD THIS FILE'S HEADER REJECTS. The exact integers
# are still the primary detector; the floor is deliberately slack -- about 88%
# of the measured ratio -- so that it names a COLLAPSE of the benefit rather
# than tracking a layout that moved. It is here because h < z on its own is
# satisfied by a win of one group in four thousand, which is what a reader-only
# regression produces. Measured z/h at these pins: 2.0424, 1.6794, 1.4627,
# 1.2369.
#
# The slack was chosen against both mutation families and both are recorded so
# the next person can re-derive it. The reader regression takes z/h to 1.0149,
# 1.0152, 1.0211 and 1.0363, which is below every floor. The two valid curve
# re-orientations keep it at 1.8538 to 2.0598, 1.6875 to 1.7376, 1.4376 to
# 1.4590 and 1.2340 to 1.2483, which is above every floor -- so a layout that
# genuinely moved reddens the PINS and leaves this arm green, and the two arms
# say different things about the same run.
