# pgColumnar group-skipping reads only the predicate columns' zone maps.
#
# pgcolumnar_native_group_can_match read the WHOLE group's zone maps up front
# (PgColumnarReadZoneMapList, all attributes) and used only the columns carrying
# predicates. On a wide table that is min/max buffer traffic proportional to the
# table width, for a scan that consults one or two columns. The per-column bloom
# fetch already avoids exactly this; the zone map now does too, via a per-column
# probe (PgColumnarReadZoneMapForColumn) keyed on zone_map_pkey's column_index.
#
# The measurement is width-independent: a one-predicate scan reads the same number
# of zone_map tuples whether the table has 2 columns or 30, because it fetches only
# the predicate column's zone map. Before the change the wide table read about
# width-times more. The instrument is pg_stat_all_tables.idx_tup_fetch for
# pgcolumnar.zone_map, made readable with pg_stat_force_next_flush.
#
# Removal proof: reverting to the whole-group read makes the wide table's zone_map
# fetches scale with its column count, so the wide-vs-narrow check fails.
#
# Usage:  test/native_zonemap_narrow.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
