# pgColumnar: pgcolumnar.enable_bloom_filter must govern the write side too.
#
# The setting was consulted in exactly one place, columnar_reader.c, on the read
# side. The write path gated on the column being hashable and never looked at
# it, so turning the feature off still hashed every value and still stored a
# filter for every chunk -- the user paid the cost and lost only the benefit.
#
# Measured on a 1,000,000-row table of five int columns: 8,320 kB of filters
# written into pgcolumnar.bloom with the setting off. Write time moved 10% on
# that shape and 2-3% on text, so storage is the larger part of it.
#
# The interesting risk in the fix is the other direction: a chunk written with
# no filter must still answer equality correctly, because a reader that treats
# "no filter" as "no match" would skip real rows and return fewer of them --
# silently. So the first thing asserted is that data written with the setting
# off still reads correctly with it on.
#
# Usage:  test/bloom_setting.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
