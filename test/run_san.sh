# The sanitizer gate (issue #224). The ordinary matrix is five assert builds, none
# instrumented, so a memory-safety defect that does not fault -- an unaligned load,
# an out-of-bounds read that lands inside the process -- passes green on all five.
# #225 was exactly that: an unaligned varlena-header read on the plain write path,
# benign on x86_64, that every one of the 92 suites passed with and without.
#
# This runs a subset of the suites against the ASAN+UBSAN build from
# test/build_san.sh, with sanitizer violations made fatal (UBSAN_OPTIONS and
# ASAN_OPTIONS abort_on_error), so a violation kills the backend and turns its
# suite red rather than printing a line nobody reads. The subset is the write,
# read, encode, and import/decode paths, where the hand-rolled buffer walks live;
# all 92 suites on five majors are neither needed nor affordable under
# instrumentation.
#
# Prove it works the way #224 asks: undo the fix it guards and confirm this gate
# goes red while the ordinary matrix stays green. Undo it in its TRUE pre-#225
# form -- delete the PgColumnarVarSizeAnyUnaligned helper and restore VARSIZE_ANY at
# the three call sites (columnar_encoding.c, columnar_reader.c x2). That reports
# the misalignment (about 20 of the 23 suites, at columnar_encoding.c:1135).
# Do NOT instead rewrite the helper's body to the cast while keeping the inline
# wrapper: clang stops emitting the alignment check across that inline boundary at
# -O1, the gate stays green, and it looks like a proof that the gate does not work.
#
# That same boundary is the gate's one stated limit: a future regression that
# reintroduces an unaligned read from inside an inlined wrapper would not be
# reported here. "The sanitizer gate is green" means the defects in the forms it
# exercises are absent, not that no unaligned access exists anywhere.
