# The planner's zone-map sample is one-based, complete, and per-column.
#
# pgcolumnar_zonemap_survival prices a restricted columnar scan by sampling row
# groups and asking the reader's own skip predicates how many survive. Two things
# were wrong with how it sampled.
#
# ONE-BASED. The stride was g = i * ngroups / nsample for i in [0, nsample), so it
# ran over [0, ngroups). A row group number is the stripe id reserved from the
# metapage (columnar_write_state.c), and the metapage starts reservedStripeId at 1,
# so group 0 exists on no table: the first probe was always spent on a number that
# could not exist, and group ngroups was never probed at all. When ngroups fits in
# PGCOLUMNAR_PRUNE_SAMPLE_GROUPS the loop is a census, and it was a census that
# omitted the newest group every time. The same predicate was therefore priced
# differently according to WHERE in the table its groups sat -- and the half that
# came out cheap was the recency predicate this engine is aimed at.
#
# PER-COLUMN. It called PgColumnarReadZoneMapList, which keys on (storage_id,
# group_number) against a four-column index, so it fetched every column's and every
# vector's row and then used one column's. pgcolumnar_native_group_can_match asks
# the same question with a three-key per-column probe (#314); the estimator now
# asks it the same way, so its reads no longer scale with table width.
#
# The instrument is pg_stat_all_tables.idx_tup_fetch for pgcolumnar.zone_map, split
# into PLANNING (EXPLAIN, which runs the estimator and no executor) and EXECUTION,
# and made readable with pg_stat_force_next_flush. The per-table stripe_row_limit
# option is used rather than the session GUC, so the suite does not depend on the
# separate question of which limit the survival estimate reads (#817).
#
# Removal proof, both halves measured:
#   - restore the zero-based stride and the two CENSUS checks read 9 of 10 groups
#     while the mirror pair splits 166.89 against 200.27 and the narrow pair 33.38
#     against 66.76, exactly half;
#   - restore the whole-group probe and WIDTH reads 600 against 40.
#
# Usage:  test/zonemap_estimate_sample.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
