# pgColumnar parallel degree (#451).
#
# How MUCH parallelism the planner grants a columnar scan, as distinct from
# whether parallel execution is correct -- that is parallel.sh's subject.
#
# THE DEFECT
#
# compute_parallel_worker() sizes a parallel scan from pg_class.relpages, on the
# ladder 1 + floor(log3(relpages / min_parallel_table_scan_size)). We hand it our
# COMPRESSED page count, so the same data gets fewer workers the better we
# compress it. Measured on ClickBench: relpages 180,418 against heap's 937,344,
# giving 5 workers where heap got 7, with no cap binding.
#
# The input is wrong for us in a way it is not wrong for heap. A heap page is a
# fixed amount of deform. One of our pages holds compressed bytes that must be
# decompressed before anything can use them, so it is MORE work than a heap page,
# and we report fewer of them. The pathological consequence is that improving our
# compression makes our scans slower by moving us down a rung.
#
# WHAT THIS ASSERTS
#
# Identical data in a heap table and a columnar table must be granted the same
# number of workers. Equality rather than a floor: the same rows doing the same
# work should get the same parallelism, and a bound of ">= heap" would also pass
# a version that over-asked.
#
# NOT a fixed worker count. That would snapshot one machine's core count and mean
# nothing anywhere else.
#
# WHY min_parallel_table_scan_size IS SET AND NOT ZEROED
#
# parallel.sh sets it to 0 to force parallelism regardless of size. Doing that
# here would delete the subject: the ladder reading relpages IS the defect. It is
# set small so a modest fixture still lands on the ladder rather than under it.
#
# Usage:  test/parallel_degree.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
