# pgColumnar import against a DEFERRABLE constraint (issue #168).
#
# A deferrable constraint is checked at commit, not at insert. The import path
# maintained indexes itself and checked immediately, so an import that collided
# with a row the same transaction went on to remove failed where an ordinary
# INSERT succeeded. The importers now use the executor's index maintenance --
# ExecInsertIndexTuples selects UNIQUE_CHECK_PARTIAL for a non-immediate index
# by itself and ExecARInsertTriggers queues the recheck -- inside an
# after-trigger query level of their own.
#
# The collision has to exist WHEN THE ROW IS INSERTED and be gone by commit;
# that is what "deferred" means. Deleting the conflicting row first produces a
# transaction that commits on any build, passing against the defect. The first
# version of this file did exactly that and proved nothing.
#
# What separates a deferred check from an absent one is the second group below.
# "The import committed" is true both when deferral works and when the check
# quietly stopped happening, so a file asserting only that would pass against a
# build with constraint enforcement removed. These must still fail, and fail
# where an ordinary INSERT fails:
#
#   a duplicate that is still there at commit
#   an IMMEDIATE constraint
#   SET CONSTRAINTS ... IMMEDIATE part-way through
#   an exclusion constraint
#
# heap is the oracle throughout: every case is run against a heap table of the
# same shape, and the columnar answer has to match it rather than match a
# constant written here.
#
# Usage:  test/import_deferred.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
