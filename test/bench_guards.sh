# The benchmark's own guards (#465).
#
# bench/run_clickbench.sh publishes numbers. A benchmark that reports a failed
# load as a fast one is worse than a benchmark that does not run, because the
# number reaches documentation and nobody re-derives it.
#
# That is not hypothetical. pgcolumnar.parallel_copy prepares one transaction per
# worker, and the stock max_prepared_transactions is 0, so EVERY parallel arm
# errors out instantly. The first harness written against it printed those
# failures as
#
#     0.0s / 0.8s / 1.1s / 1.3s
#
# which is indistinguishable from perfect scaling, and is the shape a reader
# would publish. #465 records it.
#
# So the guards get a suite of their own, and it runs in the matrix even though
# the benchmark it guards does not: the benchmark needs a 15 GB download and a
# tuned cluster, while its arithmetic needs neither. Testing the decision without
# the dataset is the whole point of putting it in a file that can be sourced.
#
# Usage:  test/bench_guards.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# The argument is accepted and ignored; this suite needs no cluster.
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
