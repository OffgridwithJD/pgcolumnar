# pgColumnar #602: EXPLAIN ANALYZE must not report "Columnar Batch Fold: yes"
# for an execution that fell back to the row path.
#
# The ungrouped vectorized aggregate decides fold eligibility from the query
# shape at Begin (so plain EXPLAIN can report what will be attempted), and
# records during execution whether the fold actually ran. The two can disagree:
# a column added after some row groups exist is predicted-eligible, but the
# first old group is missing the column, pgcolumnar_native_batch_fold returns
# false before claiming any group, and the whole scan runs the row path.
# Printing the prediction under ANALYZE reported "yes" for that row-path run,
# which is exactly the line a fold-path measurement pins its premise on.
#
# Plain EXPLAIN keeps the prediction: with no execution there is nothing else
# to report, and "will this shape fold" is the useful answer there.
#
# Usage:  test/batch_fold_explain.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
