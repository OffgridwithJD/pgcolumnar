# An encoding is chosen on pre-codec bytes and stored post-codec (#1132).
#
# PgColumnarEncodeChunk picks the smallest candidate against bestLen, which
# starts at rawLen (columnar_encoding.c:2329), and every comparison is
# `len < bestLen` on UNCOMPRESSED bytes. The block codec runs afterwards, once,
# over the whole encoded region (columnar_write_state.c:1479), defaulting to
# zstd level 3. So an encoding that shrinks the bytes can still ENLARGE the
# stored chunk, because bit-packing whitens a stream the codec was exploiting.
#
# FSST is the one encoder that already decides post-codec, through
# PgColumnarFsstHelpsCompressed. This suite is the same question asked of the
# fixed-width encoders, which had no such gate.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE ARGUMENT, so it is built from the shape that fails rather
# than from a shape that happens to be convenient. Measured on ClickBench
# hits_0.parquet, the worst column was ClientEventTime: DELTA+FOR stored it
# 2.06x larger than storing it unencoded. Its shape is a HEAVY TAIL --
# 91,735 distinct values over a range of 1,707,676,369, because rare outliers
# reach back to 1971 while the typical value sits in a narrow recent band.
#
# That splits the two cost models exactly:
#   - FOR prices by RANGE, so it must size every value for the outliers;
#   - zstd prices by BYTE REDUNDANCY, and the typical value's high bytes are
#     constant, so it compresses what FOR spent bits on.
#
# Repetition alone does NOT reproduce it: a narrow-range column with 7,000
# scattered repeats was measured at 0.71x, encoding genuinely winning. The tail
# is the load-bearing ingredient, which is why the premise below asserts it.
#
# It asserts:
#   1. the tail fixture really is tail-shaped -- its range is set by outliers
#      and not by its typical value, observed rather than assumed;
#   2. a chunk is never stored larger than it would be unencoded, which is the
#      whole claim;
#   3. a column where encoding genuinely wins still encodes. This is the silent
#      direction: declining every encoding would satisfy 2 and reddens nothing;
#   4. the rows read back byte-identical against a heap mirror at every arm.
#
# Usage:  test/encode_post_codec.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
