# pgColumnar single-backend crash blast radius (#217).
#
# recovery.sh crashes the whole cluster and restarts it. This suite covers the
# other shape: one backend dies while the postmaster lives, which is the #210
# case (a SIGSEGV takes down a single backend, the postmaster reinitializes
# shared memory and drops every other session). The guarantee under test is that
# committed columnar data is intact on the far side of that, and that an
# in-flight write leaves nothing, because columnar data goes through the buffer
# manager and WAL like any other relation. If that holds, a single backend death
# is no different from any other backend death in PostgreSQL.
#
# A heap mirror written the same way is the oracle: after the crash the columnar
# table must match it exactly. The kill is repeated at more than one point in the
# write path -- asserted from wait_event, not assumed from a timing delay. Because
# the write is uncommitted either way, "no rows survived" alone cannot tell a
# crash apart from a clean abort, so every scenario also opens a sentinel session
# before the kill and asserts the reinit dropped it: that is what proves a crash
# actually happened and the durability checks are not passing vacuously.
#
# Usage:  test/native_backend_crash.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
