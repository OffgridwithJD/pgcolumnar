# pgColumnar #708: the grouped vectorized aggregate folds column-at-a-time.
#
# Before this, the grouped path (GROUP BY over one columnar relation) was fully
# row-at-a-time: PgColumnarReadNextRow per row, then slot staging,
# ExecStoreVirtualTuple, ExecQual, one ExecEvalExpr per group key, one
# FunctionCall1Coll hash per key and one FunctionCall2Coll equality per probe --
# six to eight fmgr calls a row, measured at ~920 instructions per row. The
# ungrouped path already had pgcolumnar_native_batch_fold; grouped had no
# equivalent.
#
# The grouped batch fold walks row groups, gathers each needed column's packed
# values directly, applies the delete mask, the skipped-vector map and the scan
# keys inline, and hash-probes with an inline hash and equality for key types
# whose equality IS bitwise Datum equality.
#
# TWO THINGS MUST BE PROVED SEPARATELY, and this suite is built around the
# distinction (the #545 rule, `assert-work-done-not-only-correctness`):
#
#   * The ANSWERS are unchanged. An optimisation that stops optimising still
#     returns correct answers, so the oracle arms below cannot see the fold at
#     all. They exist to catch a fold that folds WRONGLY.
#
#   * The WORK happened. "Columnar Batch Fold: yes" on the grouped node under
#     EXPLAIN ANALYZE is the only assertion that goes red when the fold stops
#     running. Delete the pgcolumnar_groupagg_batch_fold call in
#     pgcolumnar_groupagg_build and every oracle arm here stays green while the
#     work-done arms go red. That is the removal proof.
#
# Eligibility is asserted in BOTH directions. A gate that never refuses is not a
# gate, so every shape the fold must decline has its own arm AND its own oracle:
# a by-reference key, an expression key, a non-batchable aggregate, and a `<>`
# filter that no scan key expresses exactly (#715 -- if that gate did not carry
# over to the grouped path, the fold's scan-key loop would count the excluded
# rows, which is a wrong answer and not a slow one).
#

# it is an untyped literal, so it goes through NUMERIC -- which has no signed
