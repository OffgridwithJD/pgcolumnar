# The object-store module's packaging and loader (#393).
#
# The module is a SEPARATE, non-preloaded shared library, because pgColumnar loads
# through shared_preload_libraries and anything the main library links is mapped into
# the postmaster and inherited by every backend. This suite asserts that separation
# holds, because it is the property the whole design rests on and it is easy to lose
# by accident: adding one object to the main OBJS list would undo it silently.
#
# It also asserts a remote path reports a remote error. Before this, s3://bucket/key
# reached AllocateFile and reported "No such file or directory", which is true of the
# filesystem and useless to the reader.
#
# Usage:  test/objstore_module.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# Recover from a stash left by an interrupted run, and decide which kind it is.
#
# An interrupt between a move and its restore leaves a .probe or .away behind. The
# dangerous case is real: inside the broken-module arm below, this run's STAND-IN
# is installed as the module and the real one is parked at .away, so a later run
# that moved the stand-in aside would overwrite the only real copy with 19 bytes
# of garbage and destroy the installation. Running alone does not prevent it,
# because the two runs are sequential.
#
# But refusing on PRESENCE alone refuses forever. Every matrix leg runs
# `make install`, so the ordinary leftover is debris sitting beside a module that
# is already fine, and this suite then stays red on that major until somebody
# moves a file by hand. On 2026-08-06 a .probe from 15:09 did exactly that to PG17

#
# Three states, three messages, and the checks below are written so that each one
# fails if the state it names is not the state that occurred.
#
# The earlier version could not do that. A module that handles no scheme yet and a
# module that is not installed at all both produced "is not supported", so the
# absent arm passed whether or not the mv succeeded: deleting both mv lines left
# every check green. That is why the loader now names the missing module
# separately -- it is a real distinction for the operator ("install a package"
# against "this build will never read that URL"), and it is what makes this arm
# able to fail.
#
# What is still asserted here from before:
#
#  1 a missing module must report the remote path against the missing module, not
#    'could not access file "pgcolumnar_objstore"'. signalNotFound = false
#    suppresses a missing SYMBOL; a missing LIBRARY is raised earlier by
#    internal_load_library and needs a PG_TRY.
#
#  2 the SAME query must give the SAME error twice in one session. The cache flag
#    used to be set before the load, so the ereport unwound past the assignment
#    while the static kept its new value: the first read reported the raw load
#    failure and every later one reported the documented message. Two identical
#    queries, one session, two different errors, the second one plausible.
#
# Both reads run in ONE psql session on purpose. Separate sessions cannot see it.
# az:// deliberately: the scheme must be one the module recognizes as remote
# but does NOT handle. s3:// stopped qualifying when #393 M2 implemented it, and
# gs:// stopped qualifying when #621 implemented GCS interop (their no-endpoint
# errors are pinned in the loop above and in the addressing suite); az:// stays
# unhandled until an Azure milestone exists, if one ever does.
