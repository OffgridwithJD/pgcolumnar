# pgColumnar physical replication and standby redo (#241).
#
# recovery.sh covers crash redo in place, on the same data directory. This is the
# other half: pg_basebackup to a second cluster, stream a columnar workload, and
# assert the standby's tables match the primary after replay. Nothing before this
# stood up a replica; wal_envelope.sh only greps the C source for the envelope
# around the one direct XLogInsert.
#
# What this suite is really testing, stated precisely, because the issue that
# asked for it got the premise wrong:
#
#   Every WAL record this extension emits is a CORE record type. The data pages
#   go through log_newpage / log_newpage_buffer (RM_XLOG_ID) and the one direct
#   insert is XLogInsert(RM_SMGR_ID, XLOG_SMGR_TRUNCATE). There is no custom
#   resource manager, so redo is core's and a standby does NOT need this module
#   loaded to replay correctly. It needs the module to READ a columnar table,
#   because that requires the table access method handler, which is a different
#   thing from replaying the bytes.
#
# Scenario 3 tests exactly that distinction, and it is the one worth having: it
# is the standing WAL constraint (no new WAL semantics, replay must work on a
# stock binary) turned into an assertion instead of an argument.
#
# Usage:  test/replication.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# The standby needs a port of its own, and PGC_PORT + 1 is the one choice that
# cannot work. run_all_versions.sh hands each suite a port by walking upward from
# a base, one per suite per major, so PGC_PORT + 1 is the NEXT suite's primary by

# what it did: green on PG17 alone, red on PG18 inside the matrix.
#
# Draws from below the ephemeral floor, and from a band the matrix's own walk
# does not reach.
#
# The old band was 30000-38999. The ephemeral range on this box starts at 32768,
# so most of that band was inside it, and this is where that cost the most: the
# standby is started LATE, long after the port was chosen, which is the widest
# possible window for an outbound connection to be assigned the same local port.
# The result was
#
#     could not bind IPv4 address "127.0.0.1": Address already in use
#
# with nothing listening before or after -- a standby that never started, checks
# that compared against an empty result, and a failure that moved majors every
# run. portlib.sh carries the full account.
#
# Probing for free is kept, but it is now meaningful: below the floor, a port that
# probes free is still free when the standby binds it, because the kernel does not
# allocate from here.
#
# Delegates to portlib's picker rather than keeping a second copy of the same
# walk. This function WAS that second copy, and it carried the #548 defect the
# original had: no wrap at the ceiling, so a seed landing on hi-1 scanned one
# port and reported the band full with the band empty. Two copies of a walk is
# how one of them gets fixed.
