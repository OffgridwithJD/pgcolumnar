# pgColumnar #403 item 1: preimage rewriting for monotonic functions.
#
# A zone map holds `ts`. A predicate on `date_trunc('day', ts)` is about a
# FUNCTION of ts, so nothing can exclude a chunk group from it and the scan
# reads everything. Rewritten to a range on ts it prunes with the machinery that
# already exists.
#
# Measured on this fixture before the rewrite: the explicit range reads 2 of 50
# chunk groups, the date_trunc form reads all 50, and both return the same
# 10,000 rows. That 25x is the whole prize, and it is what the work arm below
# measures.
#
# THE ANSWERS CANNOT SEE THIS CHANGE. A predicate rewrite that prunes correctly
# and one that does not prune at all return identical rows, so every oracle arm
# here is there to catch a rewrite that prunes WRONGLY, and the work arm is the
# only thing that goes red when the rewrite stops happening.
#
# The three shapes that must DECLINE are as important as the one that must work,
# and each has its own arm:
#
#   * a NON-TRUNCATED constant. `date_trunc('day', ts) = '2024-02-01 12:00'`
#     matches nothing, because date_trunc never returns 12:00. The code declines
#     it, and that decline is DEFENCE IN DEPTH rather than a correctness
#     requirement -- a distinction established by removing the guard and
#     watching this suite stay green, including the arm below. Pruning to a
#     wrong range cannot return wrong rows while the keys are conservative and
#     the executor re-applies the clause, and the derived range is never
#     NARROWER than the true matching set, which here is empty and so contained
#     in every range. It becomes load-bearing the moment these keys are marked
#     exact, because the batch fold then uses them as its only row filter
#     (#715) with no recheck behind it.
#   * a timestamptz column. date_trunc(text, timestamptz) truncates in the
#     session TimeZone, so a key frozen at plan time is wrong if TimeZone
#     changes. Excluded deliberately; the arm pins that it stays excluded.
#   * a non-constant unit, which cannot be inverted at plan time at all.
#
# Usage:  test/preimage_rewrite.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
