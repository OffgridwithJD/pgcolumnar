# pgColumnar online rewrite of partially-deleted groups (Phase F3b).
# pgcolumnar.compact_rewrite() rewrites groups whose deleted fraction exceeds a
# threshold into fresh groups (dropping the dead rows) with fresh row numbers,
# ONLINE under ShareUpdateExclusiveLock. This suite proves: results match a heap
# mirror; the dead rows' space is reclaimed (deletedrows drops); INDEX scans
# return each live row exactly once despite the transient old/new row-number
# overlap (unique constraint still holds, point lookups correct); and the lock is
# ShareUpdateExclusiveLock, never AccessExclusiveLock. Concurrency is covered by
# native_rewrite_conc.sh.
#
# Usage:  test/native_rewrite.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# What makes the statement-scoped fetch cache safe (#143, #148).
#
# PgColumnarReadRowByNumber caches a decoded row group keyed by
# (storage_id, group_number). That is only sound because such a pair is never
# re-served with different bytes, which rests on two allocator properties rather
# than on any locking:
#
#   group numbers come from the monotonic metapage counter reserved in
#   PgColumnarReserveRowNumbers (meta->reservedStripeId += 1), never from the
#   catalog maximum, so retiring a group does not free its number for reuse;
#
#   a rewrite writes into freshly allocated storage rather than over the old.
#
# Both are asserted here rather than in the fetch path, because this is where a
# change would be made. If either stops holding, the cache can hand back a decode
# of bytes that no longer exist and these checks are the warning.
