# pgColumnar: the batch fold must refuse a group whose decode skipped vectors
# (#512).
#
# That day has arrived. #452 phase 1b-i taught decode to skip the vectors the
# zone maps rule out, and taught the fold to honour the same mask, so the text
# that used to stand here -- "the fold does NOT honour the skip vector ... decode
# produces every vector" -- is no longer true of any line in the tree.
#
# What the #512 guard was for: decode gaining holes before the fold learned about
# them would have made the fold re-check UNINITIALISED memory -- a wrong
# aggregate, silently, and only on data whose zone maps rule something out. It
# was an ORDERING guard, and it fired on exactly the change it was written for.
# What survives it is a narrow fallback: a skip reported without the per-vector
# map to honour it must ERROR rather than guess.
#
# So be exact about what this suite does and does not prove, because the two are
# easy to confuse now that the guard is no longer load-bearing:
#
#   this suite          the fold is REACHABLE for a shape that skips vectors, and
#                       that it accounts for the skipping it performs
#   native_vecdecode    the fold is CORRECT there -- its poison check picks a
#                       predicate that ACCEPTS 0xA5, so a fold reading an
#                       undecoded hole counts rows that are not there
#
# Neutering the surviving fallback does NOT redden this suite, and that is now
# the expected result rather than a hole: the path it guards is unreachable while
# decode and the fold honour the same mask. Measured, not assumed.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fold_skipguard.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# ---- premise one: the FOLD ARM does the skipping, and says so ---------------
#
# Read off the fold arm itself, which is the plan under test. It used to be read
# off the scalar arm with the note "same table, same predicate, same reader, so
# what it skips there it skips here" -- a proxy, and one that hid #542: the
# counter was incremented only where rows are produced, so the fold reported
# "Vectors Skipped: 0" while decoding 1 of 59 vectors. Measuring the premise on a
# plan that is not the one under test is what let that sit unnoticed.
#
# Exact values, not "greater than zero". 60,000 rows at chunk_group_row_limit
# 1024 is 59 vector positions in one group, and k BETWEEN 30000 AND 30100 lies
# inside one of them, so decode must touch exactly 1 and skip exactly 58.
#
# This is a WORK-DONE assertion, and it is the only kind that can catch a fold
# that silently stops skipping. Every other check here and in native_vecdecode is
# a correctness check, and a fold that decoded all 59 vectors would pass all of
# them: decoding everything reads real values, never a hole, so the answers stay
# right and the saving disappears in silence.
