# pgColumnar: pgcolumnar.parallel_copy can refuse a load it has already done
# (#403 item 7).
#
# THE DEFECT. A committed load whose acknowledgement the client never sees is
# retried, and the rows go in twice. Measured before this change: the same file
# loaded twice into the same table gives 100,000 rows and then 200,000.
#
# WHY THE UNIT IS THE WHOLE LOAD, not a "part". The paper this comes from keeps
# hashes of the last N inserted PARTS, because there each part commits on its
# own. pgcolumnar.parallel_copy is atomic through 2PC: the loaders PREPARE and a
# coordinator commits all or none, proved by a malformed row at line 50,001
# leaving 0 rows and 0 prepared transactions. Parts never commit independently
# here, so a part hash would deduplicate nothing that is not already
# all-or-nothing. The load is the unit.
#
# WHY IT IS OPT-IN. Discarding rows a client asked to insert is not SQL INSERT
# behaviour. It is off unless asked for, it is scoped to the bulk-load path, and
# it says what it skipped rather than returning a silent 0.
#
# WHAT MAKES TWO LOADS "THE SAME". The SHA-256 of the file's bytes, so a file
# that changed at the same path is a different load and is loaded. Path, size
# and mtime would all call that file the same one.
#
# THE ORDER OF THE TWO WRITES IS THE SAFETY ARGUMENT. The data commits first and
# the fingerprint is recorded after. A crash between them leaves data with no
# fingerprint, so a retry loads again -- which is exactly today's behaviour and
# is the safe direction. The reverse order would leave a fingerprint with no
# data, and a later load would be refused for rows that were never stored.
#
# RUN THIS AGAINST A BUILD WITH OpenSSL. The coordinator fingerprints the file
# from inside a transaction, and that is not tidiness: on a --with-openssl build
# pg_cryptohash_create registers the hash context with CurrentResourceOwner,
# which is NULL outside a transaction, and the coordinator segfaults. A build
# without OpenSSL uses the in-core SHA-2, touches no resource owner, and passes.
# This suite therefore passed on the local source builds and crashed on CI's
# packaged PostgreSQL until the transaction was added.
#
# Usage:  test/parallel_copy_dedup.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
