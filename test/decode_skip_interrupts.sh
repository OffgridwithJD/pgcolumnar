# pgColumnar skip-path interrupt discipline (Thrift + Avro).
#
# The decode_interrupts.sh suite covers the native column decoders. This covers
# the two *skip* loops that walk unconsumed fields of an attacker-authored file:
#
#   1. PgColumnarThriftSkip (columnar_thrift.c) skips every unrecognised field of
#      a Parquet footer. Its TC_LIST/TC_SET arm loops `size` times, and `size` is
#      a file-controlled varint up to 0xFFFFFFFF; TC_BOOL_TRUE/TC_BOOL_FALSE and
#      the default arm consume ZERO bytes and never set r->error. So a footer with
#      one list<bool> of 0xFFFFFFFF drives ~4.3 billion no-op iterations, and a
#      struct holding K such lists multiplies that without bound -- all from a
#      sub-2 KB file. The function had check_stack_depth() (recursion) but no
#      CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS, so the loop ignored SIGINT and statement_timeout: an
#      uninterruptible backend hang, the #686 FIFO-hang class on the footer path.
#
#   2. av_skip (columnar_avro.c) skips unconsumed Avro manifest fields. Its
#      interrupt check sat at block granularity; an array<null> block declares a
#      count up to AV_MAX_OBJECTS (50,000,000) and AV_NULL consumes zero bytes, so
#      one block ran 50M no-op skips with no per-element check. The AV_RECORD
#      field loop had none at all.
#
# Both are reachable today by an honest caller who names a hostile file:
# parquet_schema()/read_parquet() for (1), read_manifest/iceberg_scan for (2).
#
# This suite asserts the fix two ways. The functional arm crafts the bomb and
# proves a 2 s statement_timeout now aborts it (SQLSTATE 57014) instead of the
# backend spinning until a KILL: a genuine cancellation test, resolvable here --
# unlike the in-memory decoders (see decode_interrupts.sh) -- precisely because
# the unfixed loop is effectively unbounded, so there is no sub-100 ms window to
# race. The shape arm (like decode_interrupts.sh / wal_envelope.sh) pins the
# CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS into the skip bodies so a future edit that drops it fails
# here in the matrix without depending on timing.
#
# Removal proof: revert either fix and the matching functional check goes from
# 57014 to HANG (the KILL fires), and the matching shape check goes to 0.
#
# Usage:  test/decode_skip_interrupts.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
