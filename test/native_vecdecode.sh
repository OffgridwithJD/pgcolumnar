# pgColumnar: decode honours the skip vector (#452 phase 1b-i).
#
# "Columnar Vectors Skipped" has never meant what its name suggests. Decode runs
# BEFORE the skip vector exists -- pgcolumnar_native_decode_chunk at
# columnar_reader.c:1598, pgcolumnar_native_build_skipvec at :1615 -- so a vector
# the zone maps ruled out is decoded in full and the skip only stops it being
# turned into Datums. The counter says "not emitted", never "not decoded", and no
# existing counter can tell those apart.
#
# So this suite needs its own observable, "Columnar Vectors Decoded", and the
# central check is not that it moves but that it moves by EXACTLY the skipped
# count. "Decodes fewer" would pass on decoding one vector less out of thirty,
# which is the shape of a fix that does not work.
#
# Usage:  test/native_vecdecode.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# vector past id 3000. A fold that reads the poison counts rows that are not
# there and the count runs away from heap's 3000.
