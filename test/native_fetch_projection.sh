# pgColumnar fetch-by-row-number with a column projection (issue #157).
#
# Fetching a row by number decoded every column of its row group whatever the
# caller wanted. Two entry points now exist beside it: one that decodes only a
# given set of columns, and one that answers visibility and decodes nothing.
#
# Neither has a SQL surface of its own, so this exercises them through the two
# callers that use them: pgcolumnar.read_projection, which needs the base row
# only for visibility, and pgcolumnar.reconstruct_via_projection, which needs
# exactly the columns the projection does not carry.
#
# Four things are asserted.
#
# 1. The output is unchanged. This is the whole risk of the change: a projection
#    that decodes too few columns returns a null where a value belongs, and
#    nothing raises. Checked against the same query with the projection dropped,
#    which reads the base table directly, so the oracle does not share the code
#    under test.
#
# 2. Visibility still comes from the base row. The liveness entry point stops
#    before decoding anything, so a delete that it failed to see would show up as
#    a row that should have disappeared and did not.
#
# 3. The empty-set case is right. When a projection covers every column the
#    computed set comes out empty, and a Bitmapset cannot tell empty from NULL.
#    The first version of this API read NULL as "every column", so that case
#    asked for the opposite of what it meant -- invisibly, because decoding
#    everything still returns the right answer. The set now says what it means,
#    which changes behaviour on that path, so the path is checked.
#
# 4. The call sites are the new ones. A wide fixture throughout, because on a
#    narrow table decoding one column against forty is not observable.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fetch_projection.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# every value here has to come from the projection and still be right.

# THE ARM NAMED "DECODES NOTHING" COULD NOT SEE A DECODE. Both of these counted a
# CALL SITE, with its argument text, and pinned it at a literal 1 -- so they
# asserted that a particular call is still written the way it was written, which is
# not the property either name claims. Measured: plant the regression these arms
# exist to catch, a full `PgColumnarReadRowByNumber` beside the liveness check in
# the visibility path, and BOTH arms stay green, because the call they count is
# still there and the decode added next to it is invisible to them.
#
# The property is a ZERO, not a one. There are three entry points and only one of
# them decodes every column:
#
#     PgColumnarRowIsLive            answers visibility, decodes nothing
#     PgColumnarReadRowByNumberCols  decodes a given set of columns
#     PgColumnarReadRowByNumber      decodes EVERY column -- the thing to stay out
#
# So assert the file never calls the full decode. A want-zero count is also the
# shape a second honest caller cannot break: more correct callers of the two narrow
# entry points move nothing, while any full decode moves it off zero. That is the
# opposite failure direction from a count pinned at 1, which reddens on correct
# additions and stays green on wrong ones.
#
# The two premises keep the zero from being vacuous: a file that called NOTHING
# would also report zero full decodes.
