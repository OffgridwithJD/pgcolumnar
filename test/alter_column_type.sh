# pgColumnar ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE (issue #178).
#
# Phase 2 of ATRewriteTable updates pg_attribute before phase 3 scans the old
# relation, so RelationGetDescr() describes the new types while the bytes on disk
# are still the old ones. Core builds the scan's slot from tab->oldDesc for
# exactly that reason. The scan decoded against the relation instead, so every
# conversion that moved a column across a width boundary read the stored bytes as
# the wrong shape:
#
#   int -> bigint      ERROR: corrupt encoded chunk (raw length does not match value count)
#   int -> text        ERROR: corrupt encoded chunk (fixed-width encoding on a non-fixed-width column)
#   bool -> int        ERROR: corrupt encoded chunk (bit width out of range)
#   text -> int        SIGSEGV -- an integer read out of the stream and then
#                      dereferenced as a text pointer, in the USING expression
#
# Varlena-to-varlena conversions were unaffected, which is why this looked like a
# type-specific problem rather than a descriptor problem.
#
# heap is the oracle for the values. Comparing against a heap table converted the
# same way is stronger than comparing to constants written here: it is the
# property that has to hold, whatever the data.
#
# The crash case is worth keeping even though it is now just another conversion:
# it is the one where nothing between the misread and the dereference could
# notice, so it is the one that regresses silently.
#
# Usage:  test/alter_column_type.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# a run against a broken build unreadable. Ordering it here keeps the controls
# above meaningful.
