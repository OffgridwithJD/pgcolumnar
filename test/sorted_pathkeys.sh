# pgColumnar ordered paths on a physically sorted table (#751).
#
# pgcolumnar.vacuum_sorted physically orders a relation, and until this change
# the columnar scan told the planner nothing about it: every pathkeys field in
# the tree was NIL, so ORDER BY on a table that was already in that order still
# planned a Sort over the whole scan, and ORDER BY ... LIMIT n could not stop
# early.
#
# THE FAILURE MODE THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR IS SILENT WRONGNESS, NOT A MISSING
# SPEED-UP. A scan that claims an ordering the rows are not in produces wrong
# answers for LIMIT and for merge joins, and no correctness test on unordered
# data would notice, because the planner would put a Sort above it anyway. So
# the arms are in two groups and the first group is the important one:
#
#   REFUSAL arms   -- every shape where the rows are NOT in the claimed order
#                     must plan a Sort, AND must return the same rows as a heap
#                     table holding identical data. These pass trivially when
#                     no pathkeys exist at all, so they are proved by the
#                     over-claiming mutation described in the PR, not by being
#                     green here.
#   CLAIM arms     -- the shapes where the ordering is real must lose the Sort.
#                     These are what goes red without the change.
#
# Every arm that asserts a plan also asserts the ANSWER against a heap oracle
# with the same rows, because a plan check alone cannot see a wrong result and
# an answer check alone cannot see that the Sort was never removed.

# sessions. An arm for it would be this plain-INSERT arm wearing a GUC, and
# would read as coverage it does not buy. The path it looks like it covers is
# parallel_copy, which has its own arm below.

# parallel_flush has FOUR conjuncts in its gate (columnar_write_state.c), two of
# which fail silently in ordinary fixture shapes: a table created in the same
# transaction as the insert takes the serial path, and so does anything narrower
# than two columns. So the dispatch line it emits at DEBUG1 is asserted as the
# premise; without it this arm is a plain INSERT wearing a GUC.
# The dispatch premise runs on its OWN table. Taken on w_pflush it appended a
# tail before the plan was ever prepared, so the relation had no ordered path to
# retract and the arm passed with the invalidation disabled -- vacuous for the

# NEW storage, whose mark is NULL. THE MARK AND THE GROUP NUMBERING LIVE IN THE
# SAME STORAGE ROW, so numbering can only reset together with a mark that resets
# to NULL. This arm exists because that invariant is invisible: anything that
# reused a storage id, or reset numbering within one, would silence the gate and
