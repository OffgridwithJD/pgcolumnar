# pgColumnar parallel-aware ungrouped vectorized aggregate (#289 phase 5/6).
#
# pgcolumnar.enable_parallel_vector_agg makes the ungrouped batch fold
# parallel-aware: a parallel partial PgColumnarAgg under a core Gather + Finalize.
# Each worker claims distinct row groups through the shared gap-23 counter and
# emits per-worker transition state the Finalize combines. This suite proves:
#   (1) the plan Finalize Aggregate -> Gather -> parallel partial PgColumnarAgg is
#       ACTUALLY chosen with the GUC on and parallelism enabled (premise);
#   (2) count(*) is exact vs a serial oracle;
#   (3) avg/sum over float4/float8 match core's OWN parallel aggregate within
#       float-reassociation tolerance -- a parallel fold sums in worker/arrival
#       order, so the oracle is core PARALLEL Agg, never the serial fold;
#   (4) all-null, empty, more-workers-than-groups, and a not-batch-foldable
#       filter (a NULL test, which runs on the row path with the shared counter).
