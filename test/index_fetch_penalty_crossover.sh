# pgColumnar: a fetching index scan on a correlated key is priced below the
# custom scan through ~50,000 rows, while it does about 27x the work (#913).
#
# The penalty term exists for this. The measurement says it is too small. This
# suite asserts the PLAN, not a cost number: costs drift with the constants, the
# chosen node is the property. Split from #766, which closed on the opposite
# question (custom scan vs heap). Raising the custom-scan cost would enlarge the
# wrong-plan region.
#
# Independent of test/pytest/test_index_fetch_penalty_crossover.py: same public
# seam, own fixture, own observations.
#
# Usage:  test/index_fetch_penalty_crossover.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# THE ESTIMATE MUST NOT BE A SAMPLE DRAW (#1168). `ANALYZE` samples 300 x the
# statistics target rows; at the default 100 that is 30,000 of these 1,000,000,
# so the estimate for `id <= 50000` moves every run. This suite asserts a CHOSEN
# NODE where the two prices are close, and the node flips when the estimate does.
# It flaked twice in two days in the gate, once on `main` itself.
#
# 300 x 3500 = 1,050,000 >= the table, so ANALYZE reads ALL of it and the
# statistics stop being a draw. That is a STRUCTURAL fix, not a wider margin:
# there is no sample left to come out differently. Measured on PG17, bisecting
# K* = the smallest range at which the custom scan wins. EVERY ROW CARRIES ITS
# OWN n, because the first version of this table put one sample size in a header
# over rows collected under different ones:
#
#      target    n    K* mean   K* sd   K* min..max   estimate at 50,000
#       100     30     46847     1067   44706..49276  47859..52486  <- flaked

#      3500     30     47109        0   47109..47109  50000 in 30 of 30
#      3000     30     47072       64   46933..47167  49906..50189  <- control
#
# 3000 IS THE CONTROL AND IT IS THE INTERESTING ROW: 300 x 3000 = 900,000 is
# just under the table, and the wobble is back at sd 64 with the estimate exact
# in 0 of 30 draws. So the determinism comes from COVERING THE TABLE and not
# from a large target, which is the thing to keep if this fixture ever grows --
# RAISE THE TARGET WITH N, or the flake returns silently.
#
# Cost of the whole fix, PG17: ANALYZE 0.07s -> 0.41s, histogram 101 -> 3501
# bounds. K* is 47,109, so the 50,000 this suite asserts at sits 2,891 rows
# above the crossover with no variance under it.

# THIS ARM IS THE CAP'S REMOVAL PROOF, and nothing else in the suite is.
#
# The per-row term is capped at half a group. Nothing here NAMES the cap, so a
# reader asking "is that cap load-bearing, or can it be simplified away?" finds
# no arm mentioning it and concludes nothing protects it. That conclusion is
# wrong, and it was reached in writing during review of this PR before anyone
# mutated the code.
#
# Measured, deleting the cap and leaving everything else:
#
#     as written   6 passed + 0 failed
#     uncapped     FAIL  the fetch penalty leaves a clustered ORDER BY on its
#                        index: got [no (Sort)] want [yes]
#
# per_row = cpu_tuple_cost * rows * decodeUnits grows with the whole table on an
# ordered scan, so this IS the saturation case: uncapped it costs the ordered
# scan off its index, which is the #355 regression the cap exists to prevent.
#
# The arm above it is the other side. Together they bound the cap in both
# directions -- too small and the 50,000-row range stays on the index, too large
# and the ordered scan leaves it. Removing either leaves the cap pinned on one
# side only, which is the easy miss.
