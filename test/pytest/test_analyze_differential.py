"""What `pgcolumnar.analyze()` writes must have the SHAPE core ANALYZE writes.

`pg_restore_attribute_stats` takes `VARIADIC "any"` and validates each argument's
type at run time. A mistyped argument is NOT an error: the function emits a
WARNING, sets that argument to NULL, and returns cleanly having stored nothing.
A value-level suite cannot see that, because `pg_restore_attribute_stats` leaves
kinds it was not given in place -- so a statistic we failed to write is still
there, wearing core's shape, and every value assertion reads core's work and
reports on ours.

So core ANALYZE is the oracle, and the comparison is over SHAPE: for every
statistic kind written for a column, the operator and the collation stored
alongside it must match what core stored for the same kind of the same column.
A dropped argument leaves the slot absent, which a shape comparison sees at once.

INDEPENDENT OF `test/analyze_differential.sh`. Same public seam -- the catalog
after each of the two writers has run -- and nothing else shared:

  * The shell materialises an `ad_shape` table because every `q()` opens a new
    connection, and it pairs kind/op/collation with `unnest ... WITH ORDINALITY`
    joined three ways. This file holds ONE connection, reads the five slots as
    three arrays, and zips them in Python. Same pairing, different machinery.
  * The shell greps psql's output for `WARNING`. This file registers a psycopg
    notice handler. The WARNING is the thing the suite is named for, so the two
    harnesses observe it through two unrelated channels on purpose.
  * Frequencies are checked one most-common value at a time, through a
    parameterised count, rather than in one set-returning query. A failure then
    names the value that disagreed instead of returning a count of disagreements.

THE REFUSAL IS NAMED, AND THAT IS #1131. `analyze_differential.sh` declines on
PG15-17 through `check_skip`, which RECORDS the refusal under the name "the
differential analyze path". Until `expect.cannot_run` could carry a name, no port
could emit that string and `compare_to_bash` reported it MISSING however faithful
the rest was. The precondition -- the server major -- exists on both sides, which
is the case resolution 1 unblocks.

THE MAJOR IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. The shell reaches its `pgc_fail` only when
the version is unreadable; here the same property is asserted on every run, under
the same name, so the gate below is known to have been decided on a real number
rather than on an empty string that compared less-than 18.
