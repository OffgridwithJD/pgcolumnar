"""`comm`'s two inputs must be sorted in one collation, and the pin must reach them.

#552 established the rule and #1112 found the hole. `comm` requires both inputs sorted
in ITS collation and does not check: fed a mismatch it writes `input is not in sorted
order` to stderr and prints a result anyway, so in a harness whose stderr lands in a log
nobody reads, a wrong set arrives looking like an answer.

The inputs are not collation-insensitive. Measured on real suite names,
`pgc_setup`/`pg_dump_roundtrip` and `projections`/`projection_update` both swap between
`C` and `en_US.UTF-8`.

TWO HALVES, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSED. `LC_ALL=C comm <(sort a) <(sort b)`
pins only comm's own comparison: the process substitutions run in subshells of the
PARENT and inherit ITS locale. A guard that accepted `LC_ALL=C` anywhere on the line
would bless exactly the form a reader writes after reading the guard's name.

CODE LINES ONLY. The shell guard used to scan every line, prose included, so a comment
explaining the rule violated it -- a note reading "reads only the piped form" contained
the literal string the guard grepped for and flagged its own file.

Read INDEPENDENTLY of `test/selftest/070-and-comm-s-two-inputs-must.sh`: same corpus,
own implementation, own planted probes, and neither file names the other. The shell part
is a set of `grep` pipelines over the same files; this walks them in Python.
