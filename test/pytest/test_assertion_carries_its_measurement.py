"""An assertion that collapses a measurement to a constant cannot say what failed.

    expect.num(1 if abs(on - off) <= 5 else 0, 1, "...")   ->   got 0 want 1

Four measured buffer counts, reduced to a boolean BEFORE the assert. The failure
message carries none of them, so a red says only that the arm failed -- which the
word FAILED already said.

WHAT IT COST, MEASURED RATHER THAN IMAGINED (#1164). A PG 15 leg reddened
`test_a_query_that_cannot_use_the_order_does_not_pay_to_decide`, and two sessions
spent an afternoon unable to say whether the ORACLE (`|on - off| <= 5`, a six-buffer
spurious gap) or the CONTROL (`order_on > order_off + 5`, a fourteen-buffer collapse)
had failed. Those are different defects with different owners -- one of them a
planning-buffer question and the other a timing question -- and the run could not tell
them apart. Four further experiments were then aimed at a target whose identity was
unknown.

TWO BUGS, ONE SYMPTOM, and the second is the one this file is about. The runner also
captured each leg into a shell variable and grepped it for summary lines, so the full
output never reached disk. That was repaired separately. **Repairing it alone would
still have left `got 0 want 1`**, because the measurement was discarded before the
message was built. A complete log of an empty sentence is still empty.

THE RULE, and it is narrower than "do not use a conditional expression".

An `IfExp` first argument is refused when BOTH of these hold:

  (a) the failing set has MORE THAN ONE MEMBER, so the boolean does not determine
      which state was reached; AND
  (b) NEITHER BRANCH carries the value, so the message cannot recover it.

`is None`, `is not None`, `in`, `==` and `!=` are determinate: knowing the boolean
already names the failing state. So is a nothing-versus-something comparison -- `x > 0`,
`n >= 1` -- because exactly one value fails, and `got 'no' want 'yes'` fixes it.

**Nothing-versus-something is determinate WHATEVER THE LEFT SIDE LOOKS LIKE.** That
was learned the expensive way: an earlier draft keyed on the left operand being a bare
`Name`, which flagged `(st['ret'] or 0) > 0` and `st['anylog'] >= 1`. The `or 0` is a
None-guard and the subscript is a lookup; neither is a measurement, and refusing them
was syntax standing in for semantics.

THE ONE EXCEPTION, which is why the carve-out cannot be "the comparator is 0 or 1":

    'yes' if min(t_proj_run, l_proj_run, t_base_run, l_base_run) > 0 else 'no'

The comparator IS 0, and the boolean still hides WHICH of four measurements went
non-positive. An aggregate over several operands is a measurement however it is
compared, so it stays in scope.

A TEST MAY BE A BOOLEAN COMBINATION, and both reviewers' first implementations got
this right or wrong by accident rather than by design. One bailed on anything that was
not a `Compare`, and silently scored `rng > 1000000000 and spread < 100000` as
determinate. The other walked the whole tree for comparisons, which reached inside
`BoolOp` for the wrong reason. It is stated here as a rule: every operand of a boolean
combination is examined, and one lossy operand is enough.

WHY THIS AND NOT A PARITY CHECK. `compare_to_bash` grades the check NAME. Two arms
grade `missing: 0` while one prints its measurement and the other prints `got 0 want 1`,
and nothing in the harness can see the difference -- which is how two of the four pairs
repaired under #1164 turned out to be PORT REGRESSIONS, where the shell original had
carried its numbers all along and the port dropped them. Name parity does not preserve
diagnostics, and no comparison of two independent implementations ever will. This
refuses the shape directly instead.

THE POPULATION, measured over the corpus before this was written rather than after:

    expect.*(<IfExp>, ...)                  190
      + both branches constant              148
        + a LOSSY test                       26   <- refused

The 26 were repaired under #1164, so this arm reaches zero on arrival. That is the
point rather than a weakness: the property is true today and nothing was holding it
there. `test_a_lossy_arm_is_caught` is what says the sweep can still see one.

THE SHELL CORPUS IS A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND ITS GUARD IS SHAPED DIFFERENTLY. It holds
55 such sites across 36 files, so its twin --
`test/selftest/540-an-arm-must-carry-its-measurement.sh` -- asserts a tracked list that
may only shrink, not zero. The asymmetry is deliberate: the two corpora are in
different states, and a guard that asserted zero over both would be claiming a property
this tree does not have.
