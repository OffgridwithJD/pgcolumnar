"""UPDATE must fan the new row number out to covering projections (#432, port of
projection_update.sh).

A projection stores the base row number and filters with the base delete vector, so
DELETE needs no rewrite of the projection. UPDATE is delete-old plus insert-new, and
the insert half used to skip fan-out: the projection kept only the deleted number,
`read_projection` returned no rows, and a planner covering-projection scan answered as
if the updated rows had been deleted.

**heap is the oracle**, as in the bash suite. Every comparison is against the same data
in a heap table, so a wrong answer that is wrong the same way on both sides is the only
thing that can slip through, and that is not a shape this defect has.

TWO THINGS THIS PORT DOES DIFFERENTLY.

**The row sets are compared as sets, in Python.** `projection_update.sh` uses
`pgc_set_hash`, which sorts the rendered rows and hashes them. Fetching and sorting
tuples here gives the same order-blind comparison without reaching into the shell
harness for it, and it means a failure prints the rows that differ rather than two
unequal hashes. The two harnesses stay independent by construction rather than by
agreement.

**The UPDATEs assert they changed something.** The bash suite issues each UPDATE and
compares afterwards. An UPDATE whose WHERE matched nothing leaves both sides identical
and every arm below it passes, having exercised no fan-out at all -- the suite would
report green for the defect it exists to catch. The premises here pin the affected row
counts, so the fixture has to keep expressing the question.
