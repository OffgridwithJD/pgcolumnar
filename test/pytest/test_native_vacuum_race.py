"""Compaction must not drop rows committed after its caller's statement snapshot.

`pgcolumnar_compact_relation` used the caller's pre-lock statement snapshot, so a row
group committed after that snapshot was invisible to the rewrite and was destroyed by
the relfilenode swap. The fix takes a fresh snapshot after the lock (#295). Covered
for `vacuum()`, `vacuum_sorted()` and `cluster()` -- the Z-order twin goes through the
same path.

Independent of test/native_vacuum_race.sh: same public seam (the maintenance
functions), own fixture, own observations. Assertion names match the shell suite so
the two can be compared by name, not by importing each other.

THE SHELL SUITE RACES ON THE CLOCK; THIS ONE DOES NOT, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The
original backgrounds a psql that runs `SELECT pg_sleep(5)` inside its transaction,
sleeps 2 in the shell, and inserts during the gap. It works, but the interleaving it
needs is produced by two sleeps rather than asserted, and the suite throws away the
one observation that would prove the race happened: session B's snapshot count is
redirected to /dev/null. If B's snapshot were taken AFTER A's commit -- a slow box, a
loaded box, a sleep that lands differently -- B would simply see all 150 rows, the
maintenance call would keep them all, and every check would pass having tested
nothing.

Two connections and no sleeps make the ordering explicit, and the premises assert it:
B sees 50 before A commits, and B still sees 50 after. The second is the load-bearing
one. It says A's rows are genuinely outside B's snapshot, which is the whole
precondition for the defect -- and it is exactly what a timing slip would destroy.
