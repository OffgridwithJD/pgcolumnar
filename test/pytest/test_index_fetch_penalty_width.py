"""The index-fetch penalty charges decode CPU by column WIDTH, not a column count.

`pgcolumnar_index_fetch_penalty` prices the row-group decode a per-row index fetch
forces. Its CPU term counted the decoded prefix's columns, so a 68-byte text column
was charged exactly what a 4-byte int4 column was. The consequence is not merely an
under-charge but an INVERTED ordering: the model let the wide table fetch about 3x
MORE rows than the narrow one before switching to a scan, when the wide table can
afford about 3x fewer (#803).

This file pins the ordering, which is the part that changes a plan, and reads it from
the PLAN rather than the clock -- so it is not a timing check and PGC_SKIP_TIMING
never applies to it. The absolute row counts are deliberately not asserted: they move
with the cost constants, and the defect is the direction.

TWO TABLES OF IDENTICAL SHAPE, DIFFERING ONLY IN COLUMN TYPE. `nproj` is the decoded
PREFIX length (`pgcolumnar_scan_decode_shape` sets `*nprefix = maxatt`, #363), so
width cannot be varied at a fixed prefix inside one table. Both prefixes are four
columns by construction.

Independent of test/index_fetch_penalty_width.sh: same public seam (EXPLAIN of an
index-forced range scan), own fixture, own observations. Assertion names match the
shell suite so the two can be compared by name, not by importing each other.

THE ROW-GROUP LIMIT IS A PER-TABLE OPTION HERE, NOT A CLUSTER SETTING. The shell twin
pins `pgcolumnar.stripe_row_limit=20000` in the cluster config, because the writing
and the planning session must not disagree about it (#806). A pytest cluster is
shared by every test in the session, so a cluster-wide setting for one file's benefit
is not available -- and is not needed: `set_options(stripe_row_limit => ...)` before
the write is durable, belongs to the table rather than to a session, and is what both
the writer and the planner read. The geometry is then read BACK from
`pgcolumnar.row_group` as a premise rather than assumed from the option.
