"""Compare a bash suite and its pytest port PROPERTY BY PROPERTY, by name.

Counting is the wrong instrument. The bash suite has 8 checks and the port has 7
tests, and that difference is legitimate: one pytest test carries two of the bash
assertions. A count comparison calls that a defect. A name comparison does not,
and it catches the thing that matters, which is a property asserted in one
harness and nowhere in the other.

The port makes this possible by passing each assertion the SAME name string the
bash check uses. That is a convention the port must keep, so this script is also
what enforces it.

THE PYTHON SIDE IS PARSED, NOT MATCHED (#432, #897)
---------------------------------------------------

This read the pytest file with a regex and got the wrong argument:

    expect.sqlstate(err, "42501", "a role with no privilege is refused")
                         ^^^^^^^ reported as the assertion's name

`[^)]*?"([^"]+)"` is lazy, so it stops at the FIRST quoted argument. For
`expect.num(got, 1, "name")` that happens to be the name and the tool looked
correct. For any helper whose WANT is itself a string it is not:

    expect.sqlstate(err, "42501", NAME)   -> "42501"
    expect.text(got, "none", NAME)        -> "none"

So every SQLSTATE assertion was read as the literal `42501`, counted as an
"extra" name the bash suite does not have, and the real property was reported
MISSING. That is a false red aimed squarely at the ports #432 exists to produce,
which are the ones replacing a `grep` on an error message with a SQLSTATE. The
tool got blinder as the work it grades got better.

It is parsed with `ast` now, and the name is the LAST string argument of the
call, which is the convention every port already follows.

INTERPOLATED NAMES ARE MATCHED AS TEMPLATES
-------------------------------------------

Both harnesses build some names at runtime, bash as `non-owner refused: ${1%%(*}`
and pytest as an f-string. Neither can be expanded without running the suite, so
this compares the SHAPE: every interpolation on both sides becomes `{}`, and two
names match when their templates do.

That is a weaker claim than a literal match and it is reported separately rather
than folded in, because a template match says the two harnesses assert a property
of the same shape, not that they assert it over the same values. A port should
still prefer literal names.

Exit status is 1 when a bash property has no counterpart of either kind.

    reports every such property MISSING -- which would push a port AWAY from the one
    idiom that keeps the two harnesses one-to-one across a repeated property.

    constants, so the other parameters of the same decorator contribute nothing.

#
# This read five of the eight. `check_unrunnable`, `check_skip` and
# `check_ratio_needs_quiet_machine` matched no branch, so a bash property asserted
# through any of them was INVISIBLE: never reported MISSING, never able to move `rc`,
# and therefore a pair could grade one-for-one because the grader could not see the
# gap. `hilbert_locality` was exactly that -- two of the four properties its
# unrunnable branch records had no counterpart in the port.
#
# All eight take the check NAME as `$1`, so one pattern serves them all; that is a
# property of these helpers rather than of bash, and the drift guard re-reads it.
#
# `check_ratio` is a prefix of `check_ratio_needs_quiet_machine`, and the OLD pattern
# shape could not read the longer one at all: `check(?:_num|_ratio|_text|_timing)?\s+"`
# matches `check_ratio`, needs whitespace, finds `_needs...`, backtracks to the empty
# option, needs whitespace after `check`, and fails. Measured on a fixture holding both:
# the old form reads ['short'], this one reads ['short', 'long'].
#
# The entries are written longest-first for readability. **That ordering is NOT what
# makes it work** -- Python's `re` backtracks across alternatives, so a pure reorder
# reads both names identically (measured). An arm pins the BEHAVIOUR rather than the
# order, because the order is the thing that looks load-bearing and is not.
#
# WHICH ARGUMENT CARRIES THE NAME, per helper. This is the bash mirror of
# `_NAME_ARG` above, and it exists for the same reason: a helper's name is not
# always its first argument, and a pattern that assumes so reads the wrong string
# rather than no string.
#
# `pgc_skip <capability> <message>` is the case that forced it (#1045). Its check
# name is `$2`; `$1` is a capability, written bare at 68 of its 70 call sites and
# QUOTED at the other two. A single pattern keyed to the first quoted argument
# therefore reads the name almost everywhere and the CAPABILITY at
# `pgc_skip "test_decoding" "..."` -- and a wrong name is worse than an absent one,
# because it can never be matched by a port and is reported MISSING for ever.
#
# `diff_query` and `diff_query_ordered` are the other half: `lib.sh` wrappers that
# forward their `$1` into `check`. The NAME is in the suite, only the RECORDER is

# invisible, 80 of them in `differential`, which graded one-for-one on 6 of its 86.
#
# Hand-written so the tool stays standalone, and pinned like `_NAME_ARG`: the drift

    positional into a known recorder's name slot is itself a recorder (#1053).

    TWO SHAPES, AND ONLY ONE IS A GAP. The distinction is the whole of this function:

        COMPOSE   check "non-owner refused: ${1%%(*}"    the definition states a
                                                        TEMPLATE naming the property,

    A composing wrapper is already read, correctly, out of the suite file -- which is
    why `native_ownership` grades one-for-one today. Treating it as unreadable and
    refusing it would have broken three COMPLETE pairs to fix nothing; measured, at 32
    suites refused including `hilbert_cluster`, `hilbert_locality` and
    `native_ownership`. So only FORWARDING wrappers are returned here, and the call
    sites are where their names are read.

    The unreadable list is the refuse half: a helper that reaches a recorder with a
    name slot this cannot resolve at all. Skipping it silently is how 147 names in 14
    suites came to be ungraded.
