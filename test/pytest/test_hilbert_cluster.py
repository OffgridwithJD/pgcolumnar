"""Port of test/hilbert_cluster.sh: the Hilbert clustering SQL surface (#889, #432).

WHAT THIS PORTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The bash suite pins the SQL
surface of `pgcolumnar.cluster_hilbert` and `recluster_hilbert`, the recorded
`sorted_kind`, the self-gate and the daemon. `test/hilbert_curve.sh` pins the
CURVE itself in C, and neither file re-tests the other. This port keeps that
division: nothing here compares a verb's output against the pinned encoder,
because there is no SQL exposure of `cluster_hilbert_transpose` to compare
against.

THE ONE PLACE THIS PORT ASSERTS THE PROPERTY MORE DIRECTLY THAN THE ORIGINAL.
The bash `sqlstate()` runs psql with a SENTINEL statement behind the one under
test, because psql cannot otherwise distinguish "the statement raised no error"
from "the probe never reached the server" -- both produce no ERROR line, and a
probe that could not connect therefore read as success. That is a limitation of
reading a subprocess's text, not a property of PostgreSQL. psycopg separates the
two at the type level: a connection that cannot be opened raises
`OperationalError` from `connect()`, and a statement that raises carries
`.sqlstate` on the exception. So `_sqlstate` below returns PROBE_UNREACHABLE from
the connect failure itself rather than from the absence of a sentinel in stdout.

THE PROPERTY IS UNCHANGED AND BOTH CONTROLS ARE KEPT. "noerror means the server
answered" still needs proving, so the NOLOGIN control is ported as-is: a role
that cannot open a session must produce PROBE_UNREACHABLE and not noerror. A
port that dropped it because "psycopg makes that impossible" would be asserting
its own implementation rather than the property.

SQLSTATE, NEVER MESSAGE TEXT, for the reason the bash header gives: a grep for
"permission denied" is also satisfied by a login FATAL, a missing function
(42883), a bad argument (22023) or a transaction-block refusal (25001). Only
aclcheck_error produces 42501.

# =============================================================================
#
# This is the arm the ruling exists for, so it DRIVES THE DAEMON. The daemon
# builds its own call at src/columnar_autovacuum.c:283-291 and hard-codes
# `pgcolumnar.recluster`; calling recluster() from the test and reasoning about
# what the daemon would do answers the neighbouring question.
#
# Three twins from one fixture, with identical appended decay:
#
#   av_hi   hilbert, left decayed -- the DAEMON's subject
#   av_ref  hilbert, reclustered BY HAND -- what a Hilbert rewrite produces
#   av_zo   zorder,  reclustered BY HAND -- the control that makes "the layout
#           is a Hilbert layout" a discrimination rather than a restatement
#
# THE REFERENCES ARE FROZEN ACROSS THE DAEMON'S WINDOW. "av_hi came to match the
# hilbert twin" is also satisfied by the daemon reclustering the TWIN, which is
# what happened when a stubbed recluster_hilbert left av_ref's tail unfolded and
# therefore due. Their digests are captured before the daemon is enabled and
# asserted unchanged after, and the daemon's own LOG LINE names the dispatch, so
# the actor is read rather than inferred.
#
# WHERE THIS PORT DIFFERS FROM THE BASH SUITE, AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC. The bash
# suite hands its naptime and thresholds to the server through PGC_EXTRA_CONF
# before `pgc_setup`, so they are in postgresql.conf for the launcher, its
# workers and every session. `pgc_cluster.py` hard-codes its own conf and has no
# such hook. All four `pgcolumnar.autovacuum*` GUCs are PGC_SIGHUP
# (src/columnar_tableam.c:3262, 3272, 3281, 3290), so this fixture sets them by
# ALTER SYSTEM and reloads -- which reaches the launcher and its workers the same
# way. What it does NOT reproduce is the bash suite's guarantee that no fixture
# was ever built under a different threshold: here the tables are created first
# and the thresholds set before the daemon is turned on, so the window exists and
# is empty rather than impossible.
