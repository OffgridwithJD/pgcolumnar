"""A residual must be counted from the names, never derived by subtraction.

#999 and #1006, filed independently by both sessions off the same runs. Every PG 17
matrix report on `main` printed a count that cannot exist::

    suites that ran: 243 of 252 (skipped: 9, incomplete: 0)
    of those, 248 accounted for their checks and -5 did not

Minus five suites. PG 18 printed -2 the same day, from 246 ran.

THE TWO TERMS COUNT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. ``suites_ran`` excludes a skipped suite;
``_acc_any`` counts every registered suite whose LOG shows an accounting line, and a
skipped suite still prints one, because ``pgc_summary`` emits it on every exit path
before it decides the status. Subtracting one from the other goes negative as soon as
any suite skips and accounts.

WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT. The residual was DERIVED, so the partition closes
arithmetically for any inputs: 248 + (-5) = 243. An ``inputs == sum(buckets)`` arm
passes on that line whatever the numbers are. It is the error ``pgc_summary`` warns
about eight lines below its own counter, committed one level up.

These tests drive the SHELL out of `run_all_versions.sh` rather than reimplementing
it in Python. A Python twin would be a second implementation and would agree with
itself; the house rule asks for two observers of one implementation. The bash-side
part, `test/selftest/510-a-residual-must-be-counted.sh`, asserts the same properties
through its own harness and neither file names the other.
