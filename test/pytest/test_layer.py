# ---- the layer's own names are reachable from the tree it polices (#924) ----

# pytest imports `conftest.py` FROM THE POLICED DIRECTORY into the policing
# interpreter, before collection, with no opt-out. So every module-level name in
# pgc_vacuity is writable by the code it judges. That is not a bug in pytest; it
# is what conftest is for. It is a defect here because this layer's whole job is
# to refuse, and a refusal that can be deleted in two lines is a suggestion.
#
# #958 closed the datum one exploit used (`_ORDER_KILLERS`) by binding it in a
# default argument. The three scans that READ such data are module-level names
# themselves, one frame further out, and each is a two-line conftest away from
# being a no-op. Measured on main 226f805 with the pinned runner:
#
#     GUARD               no conftest    with the rebind
#     order collapse      REFUSED rc=4   PASSED rc=0
#     broad except        REFUSED rc=4   PASSED rc=0
#     raises not pinned   REFUSED rc=4   PASSED rc=0
#
# The fix is not another name moved out of reach. It is the layer noticing that
# one of its own bindings changed, which covers the names added after this was
# written as well as the 47 present when it was.
