"""DROP COLUMN must not invalidate a materialized projection (#432, port of
projection_drop_column.sh).

Projections are extension metadata rather than `pg_depend` objects, so PostgreSQL
accepted `DROP COLUMN` even when a projection stored that column. Dropping its sort key
left the projection's attnum pointing at a dropped `pg_attribute` row, and the next
INSERT failed in `lookup_type_cache` with "type with OID 0 does not exist" -- the table
became unwritable. Until projections can join `DROP ... CASCADE`, the dependent DROP is
refused at its public DDL boundary.

**SQLSTATE, never the message.** `2BP01` is `dependent_objects_still_exist` and `42501`
is `insufficient_privilege`; both are typed fields rather than text the server is free
to reword. The bash suite already does this, by parsing `VERBOSITY verbose` output with
`sed`. The port reads `exc.sqlstate` off the raised error, which is the same claim
without a regex over a message.

**SET ROLE, not a login role, and the two precedents disagree so the choice is stated.**
`test_projection_privilege.py` uses real logins because there the ACL layers ARE the
subject: a deny arm must prove the call reached the code that denies it, and it recorded
`SET ROLE` arms still passing with `NOLOGIN` injected. `test_native_ownership.py` uses
`SET ROLE` for the opposite reason: when only ownership is under test, requiring the role
to log in adds a way for the arm to fail that has nothing to do with the property. This
suite is the second kind. Nothing here asserts anything about connecting, so the role
never needs to.

**The schema grant is load-bearing**, and it is the trap `test_native_ownership.py`
records. `pgc_conn` puts each test in a private schema. Without USAGE on it the
non-owner gets `42P01 relation "pdc" does not exist`, because an unqualified name
resolves through `search_path` and a schema the role cannot use is simply skipped -- so
the refusal arms would fail against the wrong SQLSTATE rather than pass falsely. The
premise below fails first and names reachability instead of leaving `42501 != 42P01` to
be interpreted.

ONE THING THIS PORT ASSERTS THAT THE BASH SUITE DOES NOT. The two non-owner arms exist
to show that a stranger cannot tell a projected column from an unprojected one. The bash
suite asserts each against the literal `42501` and leaves the reader to notice they are
the same string. Here they are also compared to each other, so the property -- these two
are INDISTINGUISHABLE -- is asserted rather than implied by two separate constants.
