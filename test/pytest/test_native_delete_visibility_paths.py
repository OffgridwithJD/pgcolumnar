"""A deleted row is invisible through every access path, and a live one visible.

The delete-vector fold (OR the group's bitmaps into one mask) and the per-row bit test
are consulted by several independent paths: the columnar scan, the heap sequential scan,
the index fetch, the index-only scan, and the buffered read-your-writes path. The fold is
single-sourced in `pgcolumnar_merge_delete_vectors` and the bit test in `dv_row_deleted`,
so a deleted row must be invisible through all of them identically.

Independent of test/native_delete_visibility_paths.sh: same public seam (the live set as
each path reports it), own fixture, own observations. Assertion names match the shell
suite so the two can be compared by name, not by importing each other.

THE SHELL SUITE NAMES FOUR PATHS AND TAKES TWO. It sets `enable_seqscan=off` and
`enable_indexonlyscan=on` and trusts the names. Measured on this fixture, those settings
do not move the plan, because **none of the `enable_*` scan GUCs governs
`Custom Scan (PgColumnarScan)`**:

        arm as the shell suite runs it            plan actually taken
        sequential scan (row-emitting path)       Custom Scan
        index / bitmap scan                       Custom Scan
        index-only scan                           Custom Scan
        aggregate over the whole table            Custom Scan (vectorized aggregate)

Three arms named for three paths exercise one. The property they assert is true -- each
returns 4286 -- but three of the four are the same evidence counted three times.

`pgcolumnar.enable_custom_scan = off` is the switch that does move it, and with it each
named path is reachable and still correct:

        forced                                    plan            live set
        heap sequential                           Seq Scan            4286
        index / bitmap                            Index Scan          4286
        index-only                                Index Only Scan     4286

So this port forces the path each arm is named for and ASSERTS THE NODE before reading
the count. The shell suite is unchanged -- reported rather than edited, since this pull
request adds no bash check.
