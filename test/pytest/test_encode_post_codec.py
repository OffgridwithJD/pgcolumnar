"""An encoding is chosen pre-codec and stored post-codec (#1132).

`PgColumnarEncodeChunk` picks the smallest candidate against `bestLen`, which
starts at `rawLen`, and every comparison is on UNCOMPRESSED bytes. The block
codec runs afterwards, once, over the whole encoded region. So an encoding that
shrinks the bytes can still ENLARGE the stored chunk, because bit-packing
whitens a stream the codec was exploiting.

FSST already decides post-codec through `PgColumnarFsstHelpsCompressed`. This
is the same question asked of the encoders that had no such gate.

Independent of `test/encode_post_codec.sh` per CONTEXT.md: same public seams --
the encoding descriptor and `column_chunk.page_length` -- but its own cluster,
its own table names, its own corpus constants, and the descriptor decoded here
in Python rather than through `get_byte()` in SQL. The two agree on the
property, not on the implementation.

THE FIXTURE IS THE ARGUMENT. Measured on ClickBench `hits_0.parquet`, the worst
column was `ClientEventTime`: stored 2.06x larger encoded than raw. Its shape is
a heavy tail -- rare outliers stretch the range while the typical value stays in
a narrow band -- which splits the two cost models exactly:

  * FOR prices by RANGE, so every value is sized for the outliers;
  * zstd prices by BYTE REDUNDANCY, and the typical value's high bytes are
    constant, so it compresses what FOR spent bits on.

Repetition alone does NOT reproduce it (measured 0.71x, encoding winning), which
is why the first premise asserts the tail rather than assuming it.
