"""A covering projection must be priced from its own pages.

PgColumnarSetRelPathlist offers a covering-projection path by scaling the
BASE scan's run cost. That run's I/O term is seq_page_cost * rel->pages,
the whole relation file. A covering projection has its own row groups.

This file asserts the PLANNER ratio, not a runtime. Independent of
test/projection_scan_io.sh: same public seam (EXPLAIN cost of a covering
projection vs the relation's pages), own fixture, own observations.
Assertion names match the shell suite so the two can be compared by name,
not by importing each other.

    That function has three returns. `test_projection_scan_io` reaches two of them: the
    miss (`proj_storage_id = 0` -> fallbackPages) and the covering arm. The third is
    `if (pages < 1) pages = 1`, and it is NOT the "small projection" case --
    COLUMNAR_PAGE_ROUND_UP rounds every group to a WHOLE page, so one row is already a
    full page and returns through the covering arm. Probed at all three returns:

        empty table + projection   bytes=0       pages=0   this return
        one row                    bytes=8168    pages=1   covering return

    projection" measures the covering return and reports green having never reached this

    THE ORACLE IS THE PLAN, NOT A COST. Priced at one page the covering path wins;
    mutated to `pages = 997` it loses and the projection leaves the plan. `_plan` already
    sets seq_page_cost = 1000, so one page against 997 is not a marginal difference, and
    a pinned cost would move with every unrelated change to the cost model.
