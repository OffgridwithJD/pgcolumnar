"""A column with no nulls must not store a validity bitmap (#1130).

`flush_one_column` builds the page as `[validity][finalData]`. The bitmap is one
bit per row, allocated unconditionally and appended RAW, ahead of the block
codec, which therefore never sees it -- so a column that holds no null at all
still stored `ceil(rows / 8)` bytes of `0xFF` for ever.

Measured on ClickBench `hits_0.parquet` (1,000,000 rows, 105 columns, no null in
any of them): 16.80% of everything stored. On a column that encodes well it
dominates the page -- 99.5% on a sorted bigint, where the values themselves came
to 135 bytes.

THE MEASUREMENT IS EXACT, not a ratio. With the block codec off the page is
exactly `[validity][encoded]`, so

    page_length - sum(encLen over the chunk's vectors)

IS the bitmap, with nothing else in it. So the arms below assert 0 and
`ceil(rows / 8)`, and a wrong answer cannot hide inside a tolerance.

Independent of `test/validity_elision.sh` per CONTEXT.md: the same public seams
-- `pgcolumnar.column_chunk` and the encoding descriptor -- but its own cluster,
its own table names, its own corpus size, and the descriptor decoded here in
Python bytes rather than through `get_byte()` in SQL. The codec is turned off
here with a session `SET`, which this harness can rely on because one connection
serves the whole test; the shell twin cannot, and uses `ALTER DATABASE`. The two
agree on the property, not on the implementation.

THE FETCH PATH IS A SECOND READER and it gets its own arms. A scan reaches a
chunk through `pgcolumnar_native_load_group`; an index scan reaches a row
through `pgcolumnar_fetch_get_row`, which reads the chunk's bytes itself.
Elision makes that path MORE likely for the columns it helps most: the coalesced
read skips a chunk whose `page_length` is below the group's bitmap size, and
dropping the bitmap is exactly what takes a well-encoded chunk below it. So a
fixture built to exercise the elision is systematically the fixture that lands
on the reader most likely to be left unpatched -- which is what happened here:
the first implementation fixed the scan path only, and 33 suites went red.

TWO ARRANGEMENTS MAKE THE FETCH ARMS REAL, and both were found by an arm that
failed rather than by reasoning:

  * the table has a KEY column beside the measured one, because an index on the
    only column is answered by an Index Only Scan that never calls the table AM;
  * `pgcolumnar.enable_custom_scan` is off, because `enable_seqscan` does not
    govern the columnar custom scan and the planner otherwise answers from
    `Custom Scan (PgColumnarScan)` -- a scan, not a fetch.

The premise arm asserts the plan, not the row, for that reason: a row that comes
back says nothing about which reader produced it.
