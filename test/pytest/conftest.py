"""pgColumnar pytest harness: fixtures.

The vacuity layer in pgc_vacuity.py is loaded for every run through the `-p`
argument in pytest.ini, not imported here, so that a test file cannot opt out of it.

`pytester` is enabled because the layer's own tests run pytest inside pytest: a
guard is proven to REFUSE rather than assumed to.

PSYCOPG IS IMPORTED INSIDE THE FIXTURES THAT USE IT, NOT HERE, AND THAT IS
LOAD-BEARING RATHER THAN TIDINESS. conftest is imported before every run, so a
module-scope `import psycopg` made a DATABASE DRIVER a hard requirement of the
whole corpus -- including every test that never opens a connection. With the
import at module scope NO test runs without the driver, and the failure is a
conftest ImportError before collection rather than a failed test.

No count is written here. Which files need no database is decided in
test_harness_deps.py, from the corpus, and the gate's job prints what it ran:
a number in this docstring would be a hand-maintained derived value (#908).

That is the difference between "this harness needs Postgres" and "the tests that
talk to Postgres need Postgres", and it is what lets the guard-testing half of
this corpus run somewhere that has no database at all -- which is where the gate
is (README.md, "This is not in the gate yet").
