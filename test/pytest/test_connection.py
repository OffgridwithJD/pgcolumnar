    The roadmap proposed making this default depend on a storage tier, on the

    ON THIS ENGINE: our cascade runs lightweight encodings first, so zstd works on
    already-reduced bytes and its remaining cost is small against the memory traffic
    it removes. Measured on PG 17.10, 400k rows, minimum of 12, arms round-robined,
    and the none/zstd ranges do not overlap on any shape:

        shape   marginal bytes saved   scan time vs none
        rep                   +76.6%   0.92   (faster)
        rand                   -1.7%   1.14   (slower -- incompressible)
        mix                   +12.0%   0.92   (faster)

    Warm cache, which understates the saving ON THE SHAPES THAT COMPRESS: no
    physical read happens on either arm, so a cold run adds an I/O term proportional
    to bytes read and `rep` and `mix` can only widen.

    NOT SO ON `rand`, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS. There zstd writes 148,076 MORE
    bytes than none, so cold makes it worse on both terms at once -- more bytes to
    read AND the same decompression CPU -- and C(cold) > 1.14. An earlier version of
    this comment said a cold measurement "can only move further toward compression",
    full stop. That is true only where compression reduces bytes, and stating it
    unconditionally gave away the stronger argument: the incompressible shape
    degrading cold is a SECOND, independent reason for the per-table override rather
    than a global change. Reported by @OffgridwithJD.

    This arm is a pin, not a discovery. It exists so that changing the default is a
    deliberate act with a new measurement attached, rather than a line edit nobody
    has to defend. Incompressible data is a real cost and the answer there is the
    per-table override, not a different global default.
