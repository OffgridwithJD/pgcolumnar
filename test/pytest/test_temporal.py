"""A columnar table enforces temporal constraints exactly as a heap table does.

PostgreSQL 18 adds `WITHOUT OVERLAPS` primary keys and unique constraints; 19 adds
`UPDATE ... FOR PORTION OF`. Both run through the index and constraint machinery
pgColumnar integrates with, so the two storage types must agree: non-overlapping rows
accepted, overlapping rows rejected, and on 19 a FOR PORTION OF update producing the
same result set.

Independent of test/temporal.sh: same public seam (the two tables' behaviour under the
same statements), own fixture, own observations. Assertion names match the shell suite
so the two can be compared by name, not by importing each other.

Row sets are compared as sorted tuples in Python rather than through `pgc_set_hash`,
which keeps the harnesses independent by construction and prints the rows that differ
rather than two unequal hashes.

THIS PAIR EXISTS BECAUSE OF #1131. `temporal.sh` gates on `btree_gist` -- `WITHOUT
OVERLAPS` needs a GiST index over the scalar key part -- and records that refusal under
a NAME. Until `expect.cannot_run` could carry a name, a port could not emit the string
and `compare_to_bash` reported it MISSING however faithful the rest was. The gate's
precondition exists on both sides, which is the case resolution 1 unblocks.

TWO REFUSALS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A PROPERTY. The version refusal below is
deliberately UNNAMED: on 15, 16 and 17 the shell suite prints a note, calls
`pgc_summary` and exits without recording anything, so there is no name to match. An
unnamed `cannot_run` states no property, which is exactly right -- naming it would
publish a check the shell suite does not have. The btree_gist refusal IS named, because
the shell suite names it.
