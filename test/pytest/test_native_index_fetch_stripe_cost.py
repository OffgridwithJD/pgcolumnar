"""The index-fetch penalty sizes its row-group decode by the table's OPTION (#806).

`pgcolumnar_index_fetch_penalty` prices the row-group decode a per-row index fetch
forces, and that decode is one row group, so its size is the limit in force for the
table -- the per-table `stripe_row_limit` option when set. Reading only the session
GUC prices every table alike however its owner declared it.

The property is a RESPONSE, not a number: move the per-table option and the estimate
must move. Asserting a cost value would pin this box's cost constants instead.

Independent of test/native_index_fetch_stripe_cost.sh: same public seam (EXPLAIN of
an index-forced range scan), own fixture, own observations. Assertion names match the
shell suite so the two can be compared by name, not by importing each other.

THE RANGE IS 1,000 ROWS HERE AND 100,000 IN THE SHELL TWIN, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
Measured on this fixture, PG18 assert build, `enable_seqscan=off`, total cost of the
top node:

        rows matched   limit=2,000              limit=150,000
             1,000     Index Scan     51.70     Index Scan      808.98
            20,000     Index Scan    735.26     Index Scan     1752.26
            50,000     Index Scan   1827.50     Custom Scan    2004.50
           100,000     Index Scan   3657.00     Custom Scan    2004.50

At the shell twin's 100,000 rows the second arm is not an index scan at all, so the
two numbers it compares are the prices of two DIFFERENT plans. They differ, and the
check passes, but a plan flip is exactly what a changed penalty can cause -- so that
comparison cannot separate "the penalty re-priced this fetch" from "the penalty
pushed the planner onto another node". Below 20,000 rows both arms stay on the index
and the difference is a difference in the price of one plan shape, which is the
claim. The port asserts the shape before comparing the prices.

AND THE EFFECT IS THE PENALTY'S. Four cells, same fixture, 1,000 rows:

        penalty on     51.70   808.98      responds to the option
        penalty off    35.20    35.20      identical

so the arm below is not merely observing that two costs differ; the term that
carries the option into the price is named and its removal flattens both arms onto
the same number. That control is asserted, not just quoted.
