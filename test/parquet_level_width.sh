# pgColumnar #710: the Parquet level-width helper, pinned as a source invariant.
#
# pq_bits_for computes the bit width the RLE/bit-pack level encoding uses for a
# maximum definition or repetition level. Two things about it cannot be reached
# from SQL, and so cannot be tested behaviourally:
#
#   1. It was DUPLICATED, once in the writer and once in the reader, byte
#      identical with nothing making them stay that way. A writer and a reader
#      that disagree on a level width produce a file that is silently wrong
#      rather than one that fails to parse, which is the same hazard
#      columnar_parquet_format.h was created to end for the format constants.
#
#   2. Its loop was `while ((1 << b) <= maxval)`, and `1 << b` is signed, so it
#      is undefined once b reaches 31 -- which the loop reaches for any
#      maxval >= 2^30. Levels accumulate one per nesting level from a recursion
#      that check_stack_depth bounds, so a real schema cannot get there; but it
#      is undefined behaviour in a decoder that reads attacker-authored files,
#      and a compiler is entitled to assume it cannot happen.
#
# The VALUES are already covered behaviourally: parquet_nested,
# parquet_nested_import and native_parquet_multifile all round-trip schemas with
# real definition and repetition levels, and an implementation that computed a
# different width would corrupt them. Verified separately that old and new agree
# on every reachable input (0 through 2^29) before this shipped, so those suites
# are the correctness gate and this suite is not duplicating them.
#
# What this pins is the part no query can reach. It is deliberately a source
# check, in the same spirit as the placement arms in decode_interrupts.sh.
#
# Usage:  test/parquet_level_width.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
