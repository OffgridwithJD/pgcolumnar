# pgColumnar zone min/max via the direct comparison path (issue #155).
#
# Tracking a chunk's min and max costs two comparisons per value per column, and
# routing both through fmgr is most of what they cost. Integer-family columns now
# compare directly, and the maximum is tested first so an ascending load -- what a
# bulk load of a serial or timestamp column produces -- needs one comparison per
# value rather than two.
#
# The risk this carries is not a crash. A zone map drives row-group skipping, so a
# minimum that is too high or a maximum that is too low makes the reader skip a
# group that does hold matching rows and the query silently returns fewer. That is
# the failure this file is built to catch, so the checks are differential against
# a heap mirror over predicates that sit exactly on the chunk bounds.
#
# The float case has its own check and is the reason floats are deliberately NOT
# on the fast path. btree float ordering puts NaN above every other value; a C
# comparison gets that wrong, because every comparison against NaN is false, so
# NaN would read as equal and never become a chunk's maximum. A later change that
# adds float4/float8 to the fast list fails here rather than silently losing rows.
#
# Usage:  test/write_minmax_fastpath.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
