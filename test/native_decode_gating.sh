# pgColumnar: gate payload-column decode for UNPRUNABLE quals (#452 phase 2).
#
# Phase 1b-ii taught the skip vector to say "no row in this vector matches",
# but only for predicates the reader admits as SkipPredicates -- btree
# comparisons. A leading-wildcard LIKE ('%needle%') is never a SkipPredicate, so
# numPredicates is 0, refine_skipvec returns early, no mask is built, and the
# payload columns are decoded for EVERY vector no matter how few rows survive.
# That is the case ClickBench q21-q24 live in and the one #452 is named after.
#
# Phase 1a already evaluates this exact qual, but per ROW in the producer, AFTER
# both decode passes, so it saves materialization and never decode. Phase 2
# hoists that same executor-qual callback to group-load time and runs it per
# VECTOR between the two passes: a vector no row can pass is marked in
# nativeSkipVec, so pass 1 skips the payload columns' decode for it -- through
# the machinery 1b-i already built.
#
# The observable is "Columnar Vector Decodes", which counts (vector, column)
# decodes. "Columnar Vectors Decoded" counts vector POSITIONS and is a per-group
# MAX across columns, so it cannot see this: the qual column is decoded for every
# position either way, and the saving is entirely in the payload columns.
#
# A LIKE qual is never convertible to a scan key, so it is never fold-eligible;
# phase 2's mask writer therefore never runs on the vectorized-aggregate path,
# and there is no fold arm here. The path premise below asserts the LIKE query
# takes the late-materialization row path, or every count is measuring the wrong
# node.
#
# Usage:  test/native_decode_gating.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# #595 added a payload-WIDTH gate (pgcolumnar.qual_skipvec_min_payload_cols,
# default 20): phase-2 decode gating runs only once the projection has at least
# that many non-qual payload columns to spare from decode, because the per-vector
# evaluation does not pay on a narrow projection. THIS suite tests the gating
# MACHINERY, not the width policy, and its fixture projects five payload columns
# -- below the default -- so under the shipped default it would not gate and every
# count below would change. Pin the width gate OFF (0 = always gate, the pre-#595
# behaviour) so the machinery is exercised whatever the threshold. The width
# POLICY has its own suite, native_decode_gate_width.sh.

# of a table with deletes the evaluator read the PREVIOUS group's mask -- freed by
# the group-context reset one load earlier. A use-after-free ASAN aborts on and
# this differential pins. It needs all three at once: more than one row group,
# deleted rows, and the unprunable qual; none of the single-group arms above
# reaches it. The heap mirror carries the identical deletes and is the oracle.
