# pgColumnar: direct-storage paths refuse a relation with RLS in force (#563).
#
# Row-level security is applied by the REWRITER to a query's range table entry.
# These functions never build a query over the relation: they open its storage
# and read or write it, so there is nothing for the rewriter to act on and every
# policy is silently bypassed.
#
# THE FIXTURE THAT MATTERS IS A ROLE THAT HOLDS SELECT AND IS POLICY-RESTRICTED.
# A role with no privilege proves nothing here, because #559's and #562's
# pg_class_aclcheck already refuses it: delete the RLS guard entirely and a
# no-privilege arm stays green. Only a granted-but-restricted caller reaches the
# RLS check with every other refuser cleared, which is the same single-refuser
# isolation as the import/export suite, one layer further in.
#
# The bar is check_enable_rls(relid, InvalidOid, true) == RLS_ENABLED:
#   RLS_NONE      no policy on the table            -> allowed
#   RLS_NONE_ENV  superuser, BYPASSRLS, unforced owner -> allowed, they already
#                 read everything, and refusing them breaks admin tooling
#   RLS_ENABLED   a policy applies to this caller   -> refused
# noError=true so the verdict does not swing with the row_security GUC.
#
# Usage:  test/rls_direct_storage.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
