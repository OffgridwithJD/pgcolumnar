# Overlap and containment prune chunk groups and vectors (#1144).
#
# A zone map records a range column's minimum and maximum under the range type's
# own btree ordering, which sorts by lower bound and then upper bound. That
# ordering does not bound overlap: the lexicographically largest range is not the
# one reaching furthest right, so a chunk holding [1,2) and [3,100) has the same
# maximum as one holding [1,2) and [3,4). Before this, `span && ...` and
# `span @> ...` resolved through the btree family, found no strategy, and fell
# through to a post-decode filter -- measured on 200,000 rows: 0 pushed-down
# filters, 0 zone map probes, 199,881 rows removed AFTER decoding them.
#
# What this suite pins is BOTH halves, because a pruning change can be wrong in
# two directions and only one of them is visible in a counter:
#
#   CORRECTNESS   a heap mirror answers the same queries. A prune that removes a
#                 unit it should have kept LOSES ROWS, and only the oracle sees it.
#   EFFECT        the counters move. A prune that removes nothing is correct and
#                 worthless, and only the counters see that.
#
# THE SCATTERED CORPUS IS NOT A CONTROL FOR CORRECTNESS, it is the documented
# zero: this is worth nothing on an unclustered column, exactly as a min/max zone
# map is, and docs/limitations.md says so. It is asserted here so the claim in the
# documentation has something behind it.
#
# Usage:  test/range_pruning.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# Pinned in the cluster config rather than by SET, so the writing session and any
# later session agree about the geometry (#806), and so a unit is one hour of
# spans rather than whatever the default makes it.
# THE GEOMETRY IS THE MEASUREMENT. At stripe_row_limit=10000 a row group holds
# exactly ONE vector, because chunk_group_row_limit is 10000 too -- so pruning
# happens entirely at the group level and "vectors skipped" is 0 however well it
# works. The first version of this suite asserted the vector counter under that
# geometry and failed for a reason that had nothing to do with the code. One
# group of five vectors puts both levels in one fixture.

# ---- a range compares under ITS OWN collation, not its element type's ---------

# A range type is DECLARED with a collation, which the type cache carries as

# `CREATE TYPE tr AS RANGE (SUBTYPE = text, COLLATION = "en_US.utf8")` the range
# collates en_US.utf8 while text's typcollation is `default`. Summarising under
# one ordering and pruning under another makes the scan MISS ROWS -- a wrong
# answer, not an error. Found by @jdatcmd reviewing #1144.
#
# NOT REACHABLE WITH A BUILT-IN RANGE TYPE. tstzrange, daterange, int4range,
# int8range and numrange are all over non-collatable subtypes, so both
# expressions are 0 and agree however this is computed. It needs a user-defined
# range over a collatable subtype with an explicit non-default COLLATION, which
# is why every arm above passes with the defect present.

# differs from the database default cannot pose the question, and an arm that
