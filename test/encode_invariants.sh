# Encoding invariants for the #155 bulk-load optimisations.
#
# Four changes rewrote hot paths in the encoder: the FSST build skip, the
# dictionary hash, word-at-a-time bit packing, and the batched Gorilla bit
# writer. Three of them are rewrites that must emit exactly the bytes the old
# code emitted; the fourth changes a decision and claims the stored bytes are
# unchanged as a consequence. None of that was pinned by a test.
#
# What a suite can and cannot do here matters. It cannot compare against a build
# that no longer exists, so "byte-identical to the previous implementation" is not
# directly assertable. What it can do is pin the properties that make the claim
# true, and exercise the edges the rewrites introduced:
#
#   1. bit packing at every width from 1 to 64, including the width where the
#      mask special case lives, because a wrong mask or a shift-by-64 shows up as
#      wrong values rather than as a crash;
#   2. Gorilla over float patterns chosen to drive the leading and trailing zero
#      counts across their range, through the batched bit writer;
#   3. dictionary encoding on both sides of DICT_MAX_DISTINCT, since the hash
#      rewrite has to preserve first-seen assignment order to keep codes stable;
#   4. the premise the FSST skip rests on, which is the one thing in the stack
#      that is an argument rather than a mechanism: that no vector selects FSST
#      while the distinct count is at or below the dictionary cap. If that holds,
#      not building the table cannot change output. If it does not, the skip
#      changes stored bytes.
#
# Every check compares against a heap mirror rather than a literal, so a wrong
# expectation cannot be written into the test.
#
# Usage:  test/encode_invariants.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# --- 1. bit packing at every width (#285) ------------------------------------
#
# The packed width follows the largest value in the vector, so a column whose
# maximum is 2^k - 1 exercises width k. Widths 1 to 63 are driven with bigint;
# 64 needs the full range, which is where the (width == 64) mask special case
# lives and where a naive (1 << width) - 1 is undefined.
echo "-- bit-pack widths"
# One row carries the maximum so the packed width is exactly k; the rest vary so
# the vector has enough distinct values for the packing to be worth choosing.
#
# The widths stop at 32 because that is where the encoder stops choosing this
# path, not because higher widths are uninteresting. Measured: with few distinct
# values the dictionary wins above ~32 bits, and with many distinct values across
# a wide range nothing wins, because packing near the full width saves nothing
# over raw. So widths above ~32, the nine-byte field span, and the (width == 64)
# mask are defensive code that no SQL fixture can reach. They are worth keeping
# and cannot be covered here; covering them needs a C-level test rather than a
# suite. Claiming otherwise is how a check ends up passing while the thing it
# names is never executed, which an earlier version of this file did.
