# pgColumnar is not a logical decoding source (#754).
#
# docs/limitations.md states it: logical decoding reads the WAL records of heap
# tuples, columnar data reaches WAL as full-page images which carry no tuple
# structure, so no change to a columnar table is emitted. That sentence is the
# premise under a whole class of user expectations -- CDC, blue-green upgrades,
# selective logical replication -- and until this suite it was asserted nowhere.
#
# The only other logical-replication coverage in the tree, logical_subscriber.sh,
# tests the OPPOSITE direction: a heap publisher into a columnar subscriber. That
# direction works and is the shape most likely to bring users. Nothing tested
# the source direction, which is the one the limitation is about.
#
# WHY THE HEAP CONTROL IS THE LOAD-BEARING ARM. "Zero changes decoded" is what a
# working exclusion looks like and it is also what a broken slot, a mis-built
# plugin, or a query against the wrong slot looks like. The columnar arm cannot
# mean anything on its own. So a heap table of identical shape is written in the
# same transaction, through the same slot, and asserted to decode -- proving the
# instrument sees changes before the absence of one is believed.
#
# Usage:  test/logical_decoding_source.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
