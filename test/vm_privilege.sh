# pgColumnar visibility-map privilege boundary (#558).
#
# pgcolumnar.vm_selftest() writes an ALL_VISIBLE bit into a relation's
# visibility-map fork. It took an arbitrary regclass and checked nothing: not
# ownership, not any ACL, not even that the relation was columnar. CREATE FUNCTION
# grants EXECUTE to PUBLIC and the install script contains no REVOKE, so any role
# holding USAGE on the pgcolumnar schema could mark pages of ANY relation
# all-visible -- including a plain heap table it neither owned nor could read.
#
# The consequence is not an error message, it is wrong answers: an index-only scan
# over the victim skips the heap visibility check and returns deleted rows.
# Measured before the fix, on a table with 10,000 live rows and 10,000 dead ones:
#
#     index-only scan  20000        sequential scan  10000
#
# So this suite asserts the CONSEQUENCE and not merely that the call now errors.
# A suite that only checked for "must be owner" would stay green if a later change
# made the function succeed for some relation while still skipping the heap check,
# which is the shape of the original defect.
#
# Both directions are pinned, per CONTEXT.md:
#   - the unprivileged role is refused AND the scan stays correct;
#   - the OWNER is still allowed, so the gate is permission and not breakage.
#
# The schema does not grant USAGE to PUBLIC, and that is what accidentally
# contained this before it was found. It is granted here on purpose so the call
# reaches the C gate instead of stopping at the schema -- otherwise this suite
# would pass against the unfixed code and prove nothing. Sibling of
# test/server_file_privilege.sh, which makes the same argument for the
# server-file roles.
#
# Usage:  test/vm_privilege.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
