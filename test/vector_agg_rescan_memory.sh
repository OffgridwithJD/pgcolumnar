# pgColumnar #717: the vectorized aggregates must not stack a fresh set of
# pushdown scan keys in query memory on every rescan.
#
# The scalar custom scan builds its scan keys once at Begin and reuses them. The
# vectorized aggregate paths rebuild them at Exec, so a rescan (a LATERAL or
# parameterized aggregate sub-scan) built them again, into es_query_cxt, which
# lives until ExecutorEnd. Since #704 the build of an `IN (...)` key also
# detoasts the array constant and deconstructs it into elems and nulls, so the
# growth is O(rescans x array size) rather than O(rescans).
#
# Measured before the fix on 2000 rescans with a 20000-element IN-list:
# ExecutorState peaked at 362,877,504 bytes. An independent prediction from the
# mechanism alone -- 2000 x (20000 Datums + 20000 bools) -- is about 343 MB, and
# the two agreeing is what identifies the growth as THIS defect rather than
# something else that also consumes memory. After the fix, 1,572,928 bytes.
#
# THE ASSERTION HERE IS A DIFFERENTIAL, NOT A BOUND, and deliberately so.
#
# An absolute byte limit has to be picked against one machine's block sizes and
# one fixture's shape, and it silently stops meaning anything when either moves.
# Worse, it would charge this defect for memory it does not cause: the aggregate
# rescan path grows about 655 bytes per rescan WITH OR WITHOUT an IN-list, at
# slopes that measure identical, so that part is a different leak and is filed
# separately. Subtracting a no-IN-list control removes it exactly, and leaves
# only what adding the IN-list costs.
#
# Measured with the fix reverted: 179,877 bytes per rescan with a
# 20000-element IN-list against 655 without, an excess of 179,222. A prediction
# from the mechanism alone -- one Datum and one bool per element, 20000 x 9 --
# is 180,000, and the two agreeing to 0.07% is what identifies the growth as
# THIS defect rather than something else that also consumes memory. With the fix
# the two slopes are 655 and 655, an excess of zero. The control arm reads
# byte-identical before and after (131,072 -> 2,097,152 either way), which is
# what says the fix changed only the thing it claims to.
# The instrument is pg_log_backend_memory_contexts() called from a second
# session against the running backend, with the MAX taken across samples, so
# the reading does not depend on catching one particular instant.
#
# Usage:  test/vector_agg_rescan_memory.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# ---- the node's own per-rescan footprint, against core's floor (#727) -------

# caller's context. It re-executes on every rescan of a LATERAL sub-scan, and all
# of it lived until ExecutorEnd.
#
# THE FLOOR IS A HEAP TABLE, not zero. Re-executing any node costs something per
# rescan, and asserting an absolute figure would charge this node for PostgreSQL's
# own cost and would move with every release. The same query shape over a heap
# table with identical data measures that floor directly, and the excess over it
