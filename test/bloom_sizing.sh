# A bloom filter must be sized by its DISTINCT count, not its value count (#467).
#
# PgColumnarBloomBuild takes n = the number of hashes, which is the stripe's row
# count, and both of its guards test that same n. At the default stripe limit
# neither fires: `n < 64` is false because n is 150,000, and the BLOOM_MAX_BITS
# refusal only fires above n = 209,715. So every bloomable column of every stripe
# gets next_pow2(n * 10) bits regardless of cardinality -- 256 KB for a column
# with five distinct values and 256 KB for a unique one.
#
# Measured on 2M ClickBench rows: 19.3x over-provisioned, filters 361 MB raw
# against a 262 MB table, and 29% of load time.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY THIS SHAPE
#
# The defect is a SIZE, and `pgcolumnar.bloom.filter` is a bytea in a catalog
# table, so it is measured directly with octet_length. No timing, so nothing here
# is subject to PGC_SKIP_TIMING.
#
# The assertion is the RELATION between two cardinalities in the same table, not
# a literal byte count. A literal would snapshot today's next_pow2 constants and
# fail the next time BLOOM_BITS_PER_VALUE is tuned, which is not this suite's
# business.
#
# The selectivity arm is the one that matters adversarially: shrinking a filter by
# making it useless would satisfy every size check here. A filter that no longer
# skips is worthless at any size.
#
# Usage:  test/bloom_sizing.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# differ, and the on/off md5 pair is trivially equal because NEITHER side used a
# filter. This suite claimed to guard against "smaller by being useless" and did
# not. A skip oracle is the only thing that shows a probe was consulted, and it
# needs several row groups -- the single-group fixture above cannot produce one,
# because there is nothing to skip.
#
# The values are SCATTERED, and that is the whole design. With sequential k every
# group's min/max covers a narrow band, so the zone maps alone remove nine of ten
# groups and the counter reads 9 whether or not a bloom filter is consulted --
# measured, by disabling the probe and watching the number not move. Scattering
# makes every group's min/max span the full range, so zone maps can exclude
# nothing and only the bloom filter can.
