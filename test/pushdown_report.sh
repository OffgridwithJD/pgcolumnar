# pgColumnar: EXPLAIN must report the pushdown the scan performs, not the
# pushdown the planner offered it (#191).
#
# pgcolumnar_enable_qual_pushdown gates pgcolumnar_build_predicates in
# PgColumnarBeginRead, so with the setting off the reader builds no predicates and
# skips no chunk groups. cstate->nScanKeys is the planner's count and does not
# move, so EXPLAIN reported the same "Columnar Pushed-Down Filters: 1" either
# way -- telling someone who had just turned the setting off to test a theory
# that it had not taken effect.
#
# The controls below are the point of the file. Reporting 0 is easy to fake: a
# fix that reported 0 unconditionally, or that broke pushdown outright, would
# pass the headline check. So each reported number is paired with an observable
# consequence in the same plan -- rows removed by the executor's filter, and
# chunk groups skipped by the reader.

# it as pushed down. That is how #477 stayed invisible for a year: a bigint
# column against a bare integer literal reported
#
#     Columnar Pushed-Down Filters: 1
#     Columnar Chunk Groups Removed by Filter: 0
#
# which reads as "pushdown works, this predicate is just not selective" and
# actually meant "the predicate was never usable". test/zonemap_cost.sh sat in
# exactly that state for its whole life.
#
# "Columnar Usable Skip Predicates" is the second number: how many predicates the
# reader built and can exclude with. The two together say which case you are in.
#
# THE UNUSABLE ARM IS CONSTRUCTED, AND HAS TO BE. This suite first used a domain
# column, which was unusable because of a defect (#483) rather than by nature.
# That defect is fixed, so a domain now prunes exactly as its base type does and
# is no use here. Nothing in core replaces it: asked directly, the catalog has NO
# cross-type btree operator lacking an ordering proc for its pair, which the
# premise below asserts rather than assumes.
#
# So the condition is built on purpose, out of one operator and one opfamily
# entry, and it reproduces precisely the shape #477 had in production: a
# cross-type btree operator whose family has no BTORDER proc for the pair, so
# pgcolumnar_clause_to_scankey builds a key and pgcolumnar_make_predicates drops
# it.
#
# Two details are load-bearing and were each found by the fixture failing:
#
#   The right-hand type must be NON-COLLATABLE. With `text` on the right, the
#   operator's inputcollid is the default collation while a bigint column's
#   attcollation is 0, and clause_to_scankey refuses the clause on that mismatch
#   before any key is built. Both counters then read 0 and there is nothing to
#   tell apart. `oid` has no collation, so the clause survives that guard.
#
#   The function must NOT be inlinable. Written in SQL it was inlined, and the
#   qual the planner handed the scan was the built-in `>` against a bigint
#   constant, which prunes perfectly well. The EXPLAIN said
#   `Filter: (dz.b > '190000'::bigint)` and the arm quietly tested nothing.
#   plpgsql is not inlined.
