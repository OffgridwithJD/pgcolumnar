# pgColumnar: exact selection feeds back into the skip vector (#452 phase 1b-ii).
#
# Phase 1b-i taught decode to honour the skip vector, but that vector is built
# from zone maps alone: it says "min/max could not rule this vector out", never
# "no row in it actually matches". So the case #452 opens with is untouched by
# it. A predicate that matches ZERO rows while lying inside every vector's
# min/max rules out nothing, and all 105 columns of ClickBench are decoded to
# produce no rows at all.
#
# This suite builds that shape deliberately: z holds only EVEN values, and the
# predicate asks for an odd one. Every vector's min/max brackets it, so zone maps
# are useless by construction, and the premises below assert that rather than
# hope for it -- if the zone maps ever did prune this, the suite would be
# measuring 1b-i again and would pass without 1b-ii existing.
#
# The observable is "Columnar Vector Decodes", which counts (vector, column)
# decodes. That unit is the point. "Columnar Vectors Decoded" counts vector
# POSITIONS, so it cannot see this fix at all: the qual column is still decoded
# for every position, and the saving is entirely in the payload columns.
#
# Usage:  test/native_exact_selection.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
