# pgColumnar phase 4 test: indexes and constraints. Covers btree and hash index
# build and scan over a columnar table, index fetch by item pointer respecting
# the delete vector, unique/primary-key constraint enforcement (across statements and
# within a single statement), NOT NULL and CHECK constraints, heap<->columnar
# conversion round-trips, and confirmation that ordinary index scans work (with
# the index-only-scan fallback verified when the feature is turned off; the
# feature itself is covered by index_only.sh).
#
# Builds and installs the extension, spins up a throwaway PostgreSQL cluster as
# the postgres OS user, and exercises the phase 4 feature set. Written fresh for
# pgColumnar; it does not reuse any upstream test file or expected-output file.
#
# Usage:
#   test/phase4.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#
# PG_CONFIG defaults to /usr/local/pg17/bin/pg_config. Run as a user that may
# "runuser -u postgres" (e.g. root) when the current user is not postgres.

# writes `${PGC_MAJOR:-unknown}`, and PGC_MAJOR is set inside `pgc_setup` -- which
# this suite does not call, deliberately. Without this line every record it emits
# says `unknown`, and a ledger row claiming `unknown` matches no run, so none of
# these checks could ever be seeded or matched again.
#
# The runner passes the pg_config as $1 to EVERY suite, including those that need
# no cluster, so it is available here. `pgc_major_of` returns empty on a path it
# cannot run, which degrades to exactly today's `unknown` rather than to a WRONG
# major -- a guessed major would seed a row claiming a major the check was never
# observed on, which is worse than saying nothing.

# and no RESULT records, so every mechanism built on the record vocabulary -- the
# ledger, the census, checks_never_observed_red, the red-observation record,
# duplicate-name detection -- was blind to all of them. The ledger did not merely
# return nothing on this log, it REFUSED it: "no RESULT records, so there is
# nothing to reconcile".
#
# `pgc_record` takes the DISPLAY whole, so the human output below is byte-for-byte

# drop the `: $got` suffix, which is the measured value rather than a label.

# stays for the same reason: under `set -euo pipefail` a failing command aborts the
