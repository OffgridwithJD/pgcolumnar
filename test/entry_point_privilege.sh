# pgColumnar: every relation-taking entry point has a decided privilege bar (#569).
#
# This suite exists because three separate coverage scans in this tree each lost
# members of the class they were written to enumerate, and each reported success
# while doing it:
#
#   - test/server_file_privilege.sh scans for functions declaring a file-path
#     argument, so it cannot see any relation-taking function without one.
#   - the projection suite has no coverage arm at all.
#   - two enumerations written on 2026-08-10, independently, both derived the C
#     symbol as pgcolumnar_<sqlname> and therefore silently dropped
#     get_storage_id (-> pgcolumnar_relation_storageid) and columnar_handler
#     (-> pgcolumnar_handler). Nothing errored. The lists just came out shorter.
#
# Three design choices follow from those failures, and they are the whole point
# of this file:
#
#   1. ENUMERATE FROM THE CATALOG, NOT THE SCRIPT. pg_proc.prosrc IS the C
#      symbol, resolved by the server with no parsing, so no naming convention
#      can be broken. The install script is then cross-checked against it as a
#      set, which catches a function declared but not installed, or installed
#      under a different symbol.
#   2. BUCKET ON THE TYPE, NOT ON A PARAMETER NAME. "Takes a relation" is
#      proargtypes[0] = 'regclass'::regtype. Nine of these functions name that
#      parameter tablename or target rather than rel, and several put it on a
#      continuation line, so every name-based or line-oriented regex drops most
#      of the class.
#   3. ASSERT SQLSTATE, NOT ERROR TEXT. A deny arm that greps for "permission
#      denied" is satisfied by a login FATAL, a missing function (42883), a bad
#      argument (22023), or a transaction-block refusal (25001). Only
#      aclcheck_error produces 42501.
#
# Usage:  test/entry_point_privilege.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
