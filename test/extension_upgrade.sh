# pgColumnar extension-upgrade gate (#382).
#
# The failure this exists to catch is invisible to a build and to CI. Every SQL-callable
# function records its C link name in pg_proc.prosrc at CREATE EXTENSION time. Rename a
# link name in C and the old rows point at a symbol the new library no longer exports.
# Replacing only the shared library, which is exactly what a package upgrade does, then
# leaves the extension inert rather than degraded: reading an existing columnar table
# fails with "could not find function columnar_handler", and so does creating one.
#
# It compiles, it links, every suite passes on a fresh install, and every existing
# install is broken. That combination is why this needs its own gate.
#
# Not in run_all_versions.sh, for the same reason pg_upgrade.sh is not: the matrix builds
# one tree per invocation and this needs two builds of the extension at once. It is a
# second gate beside the matrix, run explicitly.
#
# Usage:
#   test/extension_upgrade.sh [PG_CONFIG] [OLD_REF_OR_DIR]
#
# PGC_UPGRADE_OLD_SRC is the same thing by environment, which is how run_all_versions.sh
# supplies it in an environment with no .git. An explicit second argument wins over it.
#
# The second argument is either a git ref or a path to an already-checked-out source
# tree. A ref defaults to the previous release and is built in a throwaway clone, so the
# working tree is never checked out from under the caller.
#
# The directory form exists because the container dev loop copies the tree WITHOUT .git
# (see docs/testing.md), so the ref form cannot work there. Point it at a second copy of
# the old source instead:
#
#   test/extension_upgrade.sh /usr/local/pg18a/bin/pg_config /root/pgcolumnar-1.0-alpha
#
# Requires a real checkout with tags when the ref form is used. That is a precondition,
# not a bug, and it is reported as one.
