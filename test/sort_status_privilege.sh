# pgColumnar: pgcolumnar.sort_status is usable by a table's owner, and only by a
# caller who may read the table (#608).
#
# Same class as stats() (#560): sort_status was LANGUAGE sql and selected
# straight from pgcolumnar.storage, row_group and options, which carry no GRANT,
# so those tables are owner-only and a COLUMNAR table's own owner is not their
# owner. The function therefore false-denied the owner of the table it reports on
# with 42501 on an internal catalog. GRANTing the catalog to PUBLIC is the wrong
# fix -- it would publish zone_map's per-column min/max/sum -- so the function
# runs SECURITY DEFINER and does the privilege check itself.
#
# THE ARMS THAT MATTER (the #607 review lesson): a deny arm alone is vacuous --
# an invoker-rights function denies EVERYONE and still passes it. So the owner
# and a SELECT-holder each getting a row are the arms that RED on the invoker
# shape, and the deny arm asserts "permission denied for table" AND that the
# refusal names the TABLE, not the internal catalog it never asked about (which
# is exactly what the invoker-rights bug refused with).
#
# Usage:  test/sort_status_privilege.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
