# pgColumnar: a covering projection must be priced from its own pages.
#
# PgColumnarSetRelPathlist offers a covering-projection path by scaling the
# BASE scan's run cost. That run's I/O term is seq_page_cost * rel->pages,
# the whole relation file (base plus every projection). A covering projection
# is stored as its own row groups; charging the base page count prices that
# scan as a full-table read of a file that also holds the base copy.
#
# This suite pins the PLANNER number, not a runtime. Independent of
# test/pytest/test_projection_scan_io.py: same public seam (EXPLAIN cost of a
# covering projection vs the relation's pages), own fixture, own observations.
#
# Usage:  test/projection_scan_io.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# ---- the third return: a projection that IS found and holds no row groups ----
#
# pgcolumnar_projection_pages has THREE returns and the arms above reach two:
# the miss (proj_storage_id = 0 -> fallbackPages) and the covering arm. The
# third is `if (pages < 1) pages = 1`, and it is not the "small projection"
# case. COLUMNAR_PAGE_ROUND_UP rounds every group to a WHOLE page, so one row is
# already a full page and returns through the covering arm. Probed at all three
# returns on 8ea98fc:
#
#     empty table + projection   bytes=0       pages=0   this return
#     one row                    bytes=8168    pages=1   covering return
#     32000 rows                 bytes=261376  pages=32  covering return
#
# So the state under test is a projection whose storage holds ZERO row groups --
# a projection on a relation nothing has been written to -- and NOT a small one.
# An arm built on "a tiny projection" measures the covering return and reports
# green having never reached this line (#1208).
#
# THE ORACLE IS THE PLAN, NOT A COST. Priced at one page the covering path wins;
# mutated to `pages = 997` it loses and the projection disappears from the plan.
# A pinned cost would move with every unrelated change to the cost model, and
# explain_scan already sets seq_page_cost = 1000, so one page against 997 is not
