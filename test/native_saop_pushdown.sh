# pgColumnar chunk-group skipping works for IN-list / = ANY(array) predicates.
#
# The scan-key builder (pgcolumnar_clause_to_scankey) accepted only OpExpr, so a
# ScalarArrayOpExpr -- `col IN (...)` or `col = ANY(array)` -- built no scan key
# and the scan read every row group, while every comparable predicate shape
# (equality, range, anchored LIKE, parameterized scalar) already pruned (#704).
#
# The fix derives a conservative [min, max] range over the array's non-NULL
# elements and emits two range keys. The executor still rechecks exact
# membership on surviving rows, so pruning can only be conservative: a group
# inside the range but holding none of the listed values is read and filtered,
# never skipped wrongly. A NULL element cannot make `= ANY` true, so ignoring
# NULLs for the range is exact.
#
# The correctness hazards, each with an arm below: a negated SAOP must build no
# keys (NOT IN admits everything outside the list); an empty or all-NULL array
# must not crash or mis-count; a parameterized array ($1 on a generic plan) is
# frozen at Begin like #697's scalars, but a correlated PARAM_EXEC array changes
# per rescan and must NOT be frozen.
#
# Usage:  test/native_saop_pushdown.sh [PG_CONFIG]

# This is a source assertion, in the style of native_fetch_cache.sh, and the

# write, because nothing in the extension can currently produce the shape. The
# builder above collapses every multi-element array into two range keys, so no
# SK_SEARCHARRAY key ever reaches pgcolumnar_make_predicates.
#
# It is guarded anyway, because the defect it prevents is silent. Such a key
# holds an ARRAY in sk_argument. Unrejected, it becomes a SkipPredicate whose
# compareValue is the array's Datum, and the column's scalar btree comparison
# then runs against a pointer to an array header. That is not a wrong answer a
# suite could catch, it is a comparison of unrelated things.
#
# THE ASSERTION IS ABOUT THE EXPRESSION, NOT ABOUT THE FILE, and that distinction
# is the whole check. An earlier draft grepped each flag name over the whole
# file, which is a claim about the file: deleting SK_ISNULL from the guard while
# naming it in a nearby comment left the suite printing
# "PASS  and it still refuses SK_ISNULL" on a tree that no longer refused it.
# Measured, not supposed. The convention this very guard introduces -- explain in
# prose why a flag is rejected -- is what would blind a file-wide grep for the
# next flag anyone documents.
#
# So the reject expression is extracted once and membership is asserted inside
# it. Extraction is a premise, because an expression that failed to extract is
# an empty string and every "is this flag in it" test would then compare one
# blank with another and pass (#823).
