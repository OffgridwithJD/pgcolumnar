# pgColumnar deferred-decode must not pfree in the caller's memory context (#720).
#
# A columnar index scan returns a DEFERRED slot: the row's address is stored and
# its columns are decoded lazily, when something asks for them. One asker is a
# sort. A merge join sorts its input, and tuplesort materialises each slot with
# copy_minimal_tuple while ITS OWN memory context is current. On PostgreSQL 17
# that context is a bump context (the bump allocator is new in 17), and a bump
# context raises "pfree is not supported by the bump memory allocator" on any
# pfree.
#
# The deferred decode pfreed there twice: the Bitmapset of needed columns (built
# with bms_add_member, freed with bms_free), and, on a storage's first fetch, the
# format-version check's catalog scan, which frees a btree search stack. Either
# aborts a plain query a planner can choose on its own -- a Merge Join over a Sort
# over an Index Scan.
#
# The fix routes both through a pfree-supporting context; the decoded values are
# unaffected because they are copied into the caller's context, where palloc is
# legal. This suite drives that plan and asserts the answer matches a heap mirror.
# It reddens on PostgreSQL 17+ before the fix (the query errors, so no value is
# returned and the check fails against the numeric oracle) and is a no-op guard on
# 15/16, which have no bump allocator and never erred.
#
# The reproducing shape is a two-key merge condition whose keys are a leading
# by-VALUE column and a by-REFERENCE column (matching the issue's variants): the
# leading int becomes tuplesort's datum1 while the by-reference key forces the
# tuple to be materialised through the deferred slot. A single sort key is the
# control that already worked and must keep working.
#
# Usage:  test/native_fetch_sort_context.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
