# pgColumnar scan cancellation (interrupt handling in the read path).
#
# The executor checks for interrupts once per tuple it receives, which is no help
# while a scan is doing work without producing a tuple. The expensive case is
# loading a row group: pgcolumnar_native_load_group() reads and decodes every
# column chunk of the group before the row loop can iterate once, and a vector
# holds up to pgcolumnar.chunk_group_row_limit values, which is user-settable and
# unbounded. Without interrupt checks inside that load, statement_timeout,
# pg_cancel_backend() and a standby's recovery conflict all wait for the whole
# decode.
#
# The check here is self-calibrating rather than a fixed millisecond threshold,
# so it means the same thing on fast and slow hardware: time an uninterrupted
# load, then time how long a deliberately short statement_timeout takes to fire
# on the same query. With interrupt checks in the decode path the timeout fires
# early in the load; without them it fires only after the load completes, so the
# two timings converge. Asserting the cancel is comfortably under half the full
# load distinguishes the two without depending on absolute speed.
#
# Usage:  test/native_cancel.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# Without interrupt checks in the load path the timeout cannot fire until the
# load finishes, so cancel and full converge. With them it fires during the load.
#
# The yardstick is the window between the two outcomes, not a bare fraction of
# `full`. `cancel` cannot go below the timeout itself, so `full / 2` is only a
# real threshold while `full` is comfortably more than twice the timeout: at
# full=155 it leaves 27 ms of headroom above a 50 ms floor, and PG17 measured
# 64-82 ms against PG18's stable 63-64, failing two runs in three on hardware
# where the cancel worked correctly every time. That is a threshold reporting the
# box, not the guard.
#
# What the guard actually distinguishes: cancel fires *during* the load (just
# after the timeout) or only *after* it (converging on `full`). So require cancel
# to land in the lower half of the interval between those two, which is
# self-calibrating in both directions and cannot be squeezed by a fast box.
#
# Which guard this actually proves, established by removing each one rather than
# from the description above: it is COLUMNAR_DECODE_INTERRUPT in
# columnar_encoding.c, the per-value decode-loop check on a 65536 stride, not the
# per-column-chunk CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS in pgcolumnar_native_load_group(). Deleting
# the per-chunk check leaves this suite green, because a two-column group reaches
# it only twice; disabling the decode-loop macro makes cancel converge on full
# (151 ms against 150) and fails this check, which is the behaviour the paragraph
# above predicts. Stated so the next person does not remove the cheap guard on the
# strength of a green run here.
