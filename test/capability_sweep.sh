# pgColumnar: no check may vanish when an optional capability is absent (#1185).
#
# A suite that runs fewer checks because a capability is missing reads exactly
# like a suite that HAS fewer checks. The accounting reconciles what ran against
# what was recorded, so a block that records nothing when it does not run is
# invisible by construction: `0 unrunnable + 0 skipped`, and PASSED. Measured on
# arrow_import.sh before #1159 fixed it, PG17:
#
#     with pyarrow     72 passed + 0 failed + 0 unrunnable + 0 skipped   PASSED
#     without          16 passed + 0 failed + 0 unrunnable + 0 skipped   PASSED
#
# THE INVARIANT IS NOT "THE NAME SETS MUST MATCH". Measured over all 30 pyarrow
# suites, 25 of them decline as a whole: one FAIL record saying the capability is
# required, and nothing else runs. That is loud and it is not this defect. A
# guard demanding equality would refuse 25 correct suites, and a guard that
# refuses correct code gets switched off and takes its rule with it.
#
# So: EITHER the absent run records every name the present run does, OR it
# records a refusal. Anything else is a check that vanished without a trace.
#
#     A  names preserved, a skip under each arm's own name     5
#     B  loud refusal: one FAIL record, nothing else ran      25
#     C  SILENT LOSS                                           0   <- must stay 0
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A MATRIX SUITE. Two runs of 30 suites is 211 seconds, which is
# a nightly rather than something every leg of every PR pays. It is a nightly
# STEP rather than a registered suite so it does not nest inside
# run_all_versions.sh, which already runs six suites at once.
#
# It is NOT gated on PGC_SKIP_TIMING: ci.yml and nightly.yml both set it, so a
# guard behind that variable never runs anywhere.
#
# Usage:  test/capability_sweep.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.

# grep -c, NEVER grep -q, DOWNSTREAM OF A PIPE. `grep -q` exits at its first
# match and closes the pipe; sed takes EPIPE and exits non-zero; under
# `set -o pipefail` the PIPELINE reports that failure although grep MATCHED, so
# the file is silently dropped. It is a race, so it drops a DIFFERENT file each
# run. Measured five times over one unchanging tree while building this file:
# grep -q gave 30, 29, 29, 29, 30 and grep -c gave 30 every time. The first
# version of this sweep therefore swept 29 suites and never ran
# native_parquet_streaming.sh. run_all_versions.sh carries the same story in
# pgc_suite_declares_accounting, from #473 and #476.
#
# AND IT EXCLUDES ITSELF, which is not housekeeping. This file names pyarrow in
# code -- the shim writes `raise ImportError` into a pyarrow.py and the premises
# import it -- so it matches its own population and the first run of it SWEPT
# ITSELF: one recursive call per suite, each bounded only by the 900s timeout,
# 20 minutes in before anything else had run. A guard whose own text satisfies
# its pattern is the defect #1222 and #1227 are about; this is the same shape
# with a wall clock instead of a count.
