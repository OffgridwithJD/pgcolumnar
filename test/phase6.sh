# pgColumnar phase 6 test: vectorized execution. Covers the vectorized scan and
# filter fast path and the vectorized aggregates (count, sum, avg, min, max)
# computed directly over decoded chunk-group arrays, the optional decompressed-
# chunk cache, and the scalar fallback for anything not vectorized.
#
# The governing property is that vectorization never changes a result: every
# check runs a query with pgcolumnar.enable_vectorization on and off and asserts
# the two outputs are identical (and, where a value is known, equal to it). The
# cache is checked the same way, on versus off. Aggregates and column types that
# the vectorized path does not handle (bigint/numeric sum and average, ordered-
# set and string aggregates, GROUP BY) must still return correct results through
# the ordinary scalar plan, which is asserted here too. A closing performance
# check times a large aggregate both ways and only logs the numbers; it never
# fails the suite on timing.
#
# Builds and installs the extension, spins up a throwaway PostgreSQL cluster as
# the postgres OS user, and exercises the phase 6 feature set. Written fresh for
# pgColumnar; it does not reuse any upstream test file or expected-output file.
#
# Usage:
#   test/phase6.sh [PG_CONFIG]
#
# PG_CONFIG defaults to /usr/local/pg17/bin/pg_config. Run as a user that may
# "runuser -u postgres" (e.g. root) when the current user is not postgres.

# this suite does not call, deliberately. Without this line every record it emits
# says `unknown`, and a ledger row claiming `unknown` matches no run, so none of
# these checks could ever be seeded or matched again.
#
# The runner passes the pg_config as $1 to EVERY suite, including those that need
# no cluster, so it is available here. `pgc_major_of` returns empty on a path it
# cannot run, which degrades to exactly today's `unknown` rather than to a WRONG
# major -- a guessed major would seed a row claiming a major the check was never
# observed on, which is worse than saying nothing.

# duplicate-name detection -- was blind to all of them. The ledger did not merely
# return nothing on this log, it REFUSED it: "no RESULT records, so there is
