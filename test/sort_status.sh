# pgColumnar sort decay visibility (#301): pgcolumnar.vacuum_sorted and
# pgcolumnar.cluster order a relation once and do not keep it ordered, so rows
# inserted afterwards append behind the ordered run. Before this change nothing
# reported how large that unsorted tail had grown, so a DBA had no way to decide
# when a re-sort was worth its cost.
#
# pgcolumnar.storage.sorted_through records the row group number the last
# ordering rewrite ended at, and pgcolumnar.sort_status reports the split. This
# suite validates that the mark means what it says: it is unset before any sort,
# it covers every group after one, it leaves an appended tail as rows are
# inserted, an unsorted rewrite clears it, and retiring a group inside the run
# does not slide the boundary onto the tail.
#
# Usage:  test/sort_status.sh [PG_CONFIG]
# Written fresh for pgColumnar.
